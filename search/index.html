                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="4 to 5 Speed Conversion" data-content="&#34; It is possible to convert a manual 4 speed vehicle to 5 speed.\nThis wiki page is for converting a factory motor. If you are intending to convert your 4 speed vehicle to 5 speed whilst also doing an engine conversion (such as a V8), please refer to this wiki page for additional considerations.\nDifferences The 5th gear in the MQ is in an extension housing between the main housing and the transfer case. The main housing and transfer are the same on the 4 and 5 speed gearboxes, making parts interchangeable. The extension housing is 100mm long. This causes the transfer case to be moved further towards the rear of the vehicle, which has 2 effects;\n The front drive-shaft needs to be longer and the rear shorter. The transfer mounts are further towards the rear of the chassis.  These 2 differences must be addressed to complete the conversion.\nIf you want to see the difference, go to gearbox length wiki page.\nSolving Drive-shafts The different drive-shaft lengths can be addressed in 3 ways.\n Source correct length drive-shafts from another MQ. Please refer to this wiki page for information. Modify the length of the current drive-shafts (recommend to take to a professional workshop, as an un-balanced drive-shaft can cause damaging vibrations). Have new drive-shafts made to suit.  Solving Transfer Mounts The different location of the transfer mounts can be addressed in 2 ways.\n Cut the old mounts from the chassis and weld on new ones in the correct location. It may be possible to re-use the cut-off mounts if they were not damaged, or replacements will need to be fabricated. Make adapter plates between the existing chassis mounts and the transfer case.     Left side (Australian passenger side) Right side (Australian drivers side)          Using Gearbox from Different MQ Engine It is also possible to use gearboxes from different engines, such as a L28 5 speed on a SD33. There are a few differences that require addressing though;\n The 3 motors all have different bell-housings. The connection of the bell-housing to the main gearbox housing is the same, so they can be interchanged. The L28 motor is not as long as the P40 and SD33, which causes the gearbox to be located further forward). Because of this, each type has a unique top-plate on the gearbox, which locates the sticks correctly through the floor (SD33 and P40 are the same). The top-plates can be exchanged between the gearboxes to suit. There are 3 different input shaft lengths, L28 = 210, SD33 and P40 pre \u0026lsquo;84 = 185, SD33 and P40 post \u0026lsquo;84 = 195. It is possible to interchange the input shafts. It may also be possible to make a modified spigot bush, however most people opt for the first option.  &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Gearbox&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

Only NZ New Patrols are generally 12VOLT NOTE- In Europe most MK\u0026rsquo;s are 24V\nAll configurations shared a common layout. The engine bay wiring loom is part of the main cabin wiring loom. The rear wiring loom (tail lights, fuel tank etc) connects to the main loom under the drivers seat (RH side in Aus). The air-con is a separate loom, which connects to the main loom under the dash.\nVarious upgrades occurred to the vehicles electronics over the years. These included the diesel fuel filter warning light and rear windscreen wiper. When swapping looms between vehicles of dissimilar years and configuration, adequate research should be performed to ensure a smooth transition.

This can be achieved by tapping the L bend manifold near the pressure relief valve.\nHowever, if the engine will be boosted above the factory 6psi, the relief valve will open and bleed off the extra boost (above 6psi). The relief valve will need to be removed to achieve full boost, leaving a threaded hole that the boost gauge could be connected to with some adapters/reducers (ie check your local plumbing store).\n\nIf the vehicle is fitted with an intercooler, the boost gauge should still be fitted as close to the engine as possible. For extra information, you may like to fit a second boost gauge as close to the turbo as possible (ie the wastegate hose). This will allow you to identify the pressure drop through your system.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - SD33&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

This section will give you a quick and dirty overview.\nThe MQ Patrol was released in early 1980. The MQ is easily identified by its round headlights. It was available in a few body styles, including 2 door short wheel base (normally a 4 seater with removable canopy), 4 door long wheel base (5 seater van or 7 seater wagon) and utes.\n3 engines were available; the L28 and P40, which were straight 6 petrol engines, and the SD33, a straight 6 diesel engine. The L28 is very common and known for its high-revving abilities. The P40 is not very common, and compared to the L28 it is like a \u0026lsquo;big-block\u0026rsquo;, making large amounts of torque at low RPM. The SD33 is a strong engine, with heaps of torque, but a little lacking in power. All the engines are very reliable if serviced and maintained regularly, and will do hundreds of thousands of kilometers.\nThe standard gearbox was the 4 speed manual. An automatic was available in L28 LWB only. All vehicles featured disc brake front and drum brakes on the rear. Manual steering was the standard, but power steering was available. Other optional extras included air conditioning, suspension seats, swing-away spare wheel and jerry-can holder, and the wide wheel pack (with steel flares). There were also a few different trim levels, mainly a budget version with vinyl floors, or the deluxe version with carpet floors. They were available in brown or blue.\nThe MQ Patrol was updated in late 1983. This \u0026lsquo;series-2\u0026rsquo; vehicle is often called the MK. It is identified by its rectangular headlights.\nThe MK bought numerous beneficial changes with it, such as improved suspension components and self adjusting drum-brakes. The SD33 was available with a turbo (the SD33T) and was also changed to a common 12 volt electrical system. This engine has gained a bit of a cult following, as it has ample power and loads of torque and can be easily modified. The 4 speed gearbox was also updated, and now featured an overdrive 5th gear. This greatly improved fuel economy and top speed.\nAs a result of the updates, the MK is definitely more desirable than an MQ, and often fetch higher $$$. Most parts are interchangeable though, so it is common to find an MQ that has been upgraded with a SD33T and 5 speed. The MK was discontinued in late 1987, when it was replaced by the GQ (Y60) Patrol in Australia and other parts of the world. In European countries, the MK lived on and was further updated, including new engines. This model is known as the 260 Patrol.\nThings to Thoroughly Inspect It is easy when buying a car, especially one of this vintage, to get caught up in the moment and end up buying a dud. It is best to spend a good deal of time thoroughly inspecting the vehicle, so you know what your getting yourself into. This way, you can save yourself from (or at least prepare for) unexpected breakages in the future. This section will prepare you with a good game plan for inspecting an MQ/MK, and give you a heads-up on some common problems.\nEngine It is recommended to buy an MQ that has the engine in it that you want. Converting petrol to diesel is not an easy proposition, requiring new engine and gearbox mounts on the chassis, as well as exhaust, drive-shaft and wiring changes. It is possible, but hardly worth the hassle.\nMany MQ Patrols around the world have received engine conversions over the years. Common in Australia is to find a Patrol with Chev, Holden or Ford V8. If you are going to purchase a car with an engine conversion, you should check that it is all permitted, for peace of mind. Also pay extra attention to the engine and gearbox mounts, to make sure that no dodgy work has been performed. Other than that, the following tips should still apply.\nIt is recommended to begin an inspection with the engine off and cool. This can provide great incite into the condition and quality of the engine.\nWith The Engine Off Remove the dipstick and inspect the oil. It should be black (or golden-brown if its very new), any other color could indicate head or gasket problems. If the oil is low, this could indicate a neglected engine or a leak. Visually inspect the oil filter, if it is old and worn, this could also indicate a neglected engine. Remove the rocker cover cap and look inside, it should be very clean. Any sludge type buildup indicates the engine has not been maintained.\nIf it is a diesel, it is important they are regularly serviced (every 5,000km). If the oil is low or the oil filter appears very old (look for change at x km stickers for clues), this could indicate a neglected engine. Ask the seller how regular they have serviced the vehicle, but don\u0026rsquo;t forget it is easy for anyone to say \u0026ldquo;oh yer, all the time\u0026rdquo;.\nIf the engine is cool, remove the radiator cap and inspect the contents. Also check the overflow container. If the cap is milky/oily, then there is head gasket problems. Check the quality and level of the fluid. If it is plain water, low on fluid, or very dirty, it is likely that little care has been given to the engine.\nLastly, inspect all the add-on components. For all engines, check the condition of the belts, inspect the air filter(s) and spin the fan by hand. Check the condition of the engine mounts, and inspect the engine for major leaks. For petrol engines, check the distributor, coil and leads all appear good condition.\nWith The Engine Running For diesels, it is best to inspect them when they are cold, so that you can check how much smoke it blows on start-up. It is natural for a diesel to blow a little white smoke on start-up, but if it bellows smoke, this could indicate other (costly) problems, such as a dud turbo or worn out piston rings. If it has a fair amount of smoke that clears up after a minute or 2, this could indicate the glow plugs need replacing, which cost ~$100 for the set.\nThe turbo diesels are prone to exhaust manifold leaks. A leak will sound like a soft ticking noise, and you can often feel the exhaust escaping (and sometimes see \u0026lsquo;burnt\u0026rsquo; areas on the head). People have found that aftermarket gaskets do not seal well, so a genuine gasket should be used. These cost ~$70.\nHopefully there will be no abnormal engine noises at this time. Any knocks/ticks could indicate serious internal problems. You should open the throttle a few times, both slowly and quickly, to ensure the engine revs up and down smoothly and consistently. Any issues at this time could indicate a dodgy fuel system (pump, carby, injector pump etc) or bad ignition system.\nWhilst Driving The engines in MQ Patrols are sufficiently powerful to keep up with traffic and do feel \u0026lsquo;lively\u0026rsquo;.\nWhen driving, put the engine through its paces. Attempt the following;\n Hard and fast take offs Slow but high revving accelerations Quick and sudden decelerations Full throttle acceleration from cruising RPM Accelerate to a moderately high RPM (ie 3500 RPM in a petrol), maintain this for a few seconds, then accelerate some more.  These tests often reveal any flaws in an engine (which are usually associated with fuel or spark systems).\nIn a diesel, try watch for any exhaust smoke. Black smoke indicates the engine is over-fueled and not burning the diesel correctly. Blue smoke is bad and indicates burning engine oil, you do not want to see this! On a good running engine, there should be no smoke most of the time, though even the best engines often put out a little black when under hard load (ie accelerating up hill).\nGearbox / Transfer The manual gearboxes and transfer are strong and rarely cause problems. They were after all designed in the Nissan truck factory, and are used in trucks like the Cabstar. Little is known of the automatics reliability off-road, however it is a standard Jatco transmission, as used in many vehicles like the Datsun 260z. It will easily handle a hot L28.\nAs previously mentioned, the MQ had a 4 speed manual and the MK was available with a 5 speed. The 5 speed is the preferred gearbox as it provides an overdrive gear (good for economy) and also has a lower first gear ratio (better for crawling). Vehicles with a 5 speed often fetch a higher price than similar spec 4 speed vehicles. It is advisable to purchase a 5 speed vehicle from the start. Converting a 4 to 5 speed is possible, and 5 speed gearboxes can be had for a few hundred dollars. However, it also requires different length drive-shafts and modified transfer to chassis mounts, hence it is easier to buy a 5 speed from the start. If you are purchasing a MQ that has been converted to 5 speed, check the transfer mounts for dodgy workmanship.\nWhen driving the vehicle, check the gearbox changes gears smoothly (for auto, also pay attention to any slip between gears or convertor flaring). It should be reasonably quiet and not emit any whirring/crunching noises. When performing the acceleration tests on the engine, the gearbox should handle this no worries. If it jumps out of gear, this would indicate internal problems, likely due to abuse.\nSimilarly, check that the gearbox engages 4H, N and 4L correctly. Drive in these gears (off-road) for a brief period, to ensure there are no problems with the transfer gears.\nClutch The clutches are fairly robust, but old age and abuse will wear them away. A slipping clutch will be noticeable during the engine acceleration tests, especially during the roll-on test. You will know the clutch is slipping, as the engine revs will pickup rather quickly (\u0026lsquo;flare\u0026rsquo;) but the vehicle will not feel like it is accelerating.\nNew clutches can be purchased for ~$500, including heavier duty models. A fair amount of work is required to change a clutch, but it is easily done at home. A workshop will likely charge hundreds of dollars to change the clutch for you, so consider this when you are purchasing.\nYou should also ensure the clutch operates smoothly. Lightly press the clutch pedal to engage the throwout bearing, then listen for any grinding noises. If this bearing needs replacing, it requires the same amount of work as changing the clutch (ie remove gearbox).\nWithin the engine bay, visually inspect the master cylinder (on the firewall) and the slave cylinder (on the bell-housing). Check for leaks or cracks. Also check the rubber hose that connects the two, as this can become brittle and leak. On vehicles with body lifts, this hose is often stretched so far that it may split. Replacement cylinders cost ~$100 each, and a new hose can cost $50.\nDiff\u0026rsquo;s (and associated) The differentials in the MQ are a strong and reliable units, when maintained. In fact, a derivative of the rear diff is still in use today in the GU Patrol.\nYou should start off by visually inspecting the diffs. There will not be much to see on the rear diff. Check around the diff centre for any leaks. Whilst a leak in the diff mating-face is easy to rectify, the gears could be damaged if the oil level has not been maintained. A leak from the pinion seal is quite time consuming to fix, and requires special tools.\nThe front diff is a bit more involved, and should be inspected closely. First, try push and pull on the top of the tyres. This will reveal any worn bearings, especially king-pin bearings. Next, head under the car and check for leaks around the diff centre (the same applies as the rear diff). Then check for sludge buildup at the ends of the diff, behind the wheels and around the \u0026lsquo;balls\u0026rsquo;. Excessive buildup indicates the wiper seals are worn and need replacing. It is also likely the inner oil seals are worn, which causes the oil to leak out of the diff centre and down the diff tubes, washing the grease out of the knuckles (balls). This can have many bad effects if not rectified quickly, such as worn CVs and bearings. New bearing and seal kits can be purchased for $200, and the job is easily performed at home.\nIf the car has manual hubs, ensure they engage smoothly. You should test drive the vehicle with the hubs locked, as long as the transfer is in 2H this will have no bad effects. Having the hubs locked will spin the CV\u0026rsquo;s, axles, diff centre and drive-shaft as you drive. If you cant take the vehicle off-road for a proper 4wd test, this is the next best thing, as you should be able to hear a damaged component. A damaged CV will sound like constant clicking. Aftermarket CV joints cost $50 each.\nWhen driving, listen out for any clunks or grinding from the diffs, which likely indicates damaged gears or worn bearings in the rear diff. If it only clunks around corners, this would indicate damaged spider gears in the diff centre. Tired/worn-out diffs/gears often emit a constant humming noise, but do not confuse this with tyre tread noise. Secondhand diffs can be purchased rather cheap, often around $150.\nDrive-shafts Whilst your head is under the car, take a look at the drive-shafts. They should be in good condition, any knocks/dents can cause vibrations whilst driving.\nBrakes Not a lot can be checked without removing the wheels and pulling down the brake components. A visual inspection of the disc rotors is worthwhile, as these are the most expensive component to replace. They should be relatively smooth, with no gouges. This would indicate the pads have worn down to the backing pads at some stage and damaged the discs surface.\nCheck the brake master cylinder on the firewall. Sometimes the seals within these can fail, so check that it is relatively clean and has no visible leaks/drips. Brake fluid acts as a paint stripper, so a leak can often be identified by pealing paint underneath the cylinder. Also remove the cap from the master cylinder and inspect the fluid. Low fluid in one or both sections of the canister would definitely indicate a leaking brake component. If the fluid is an extremely dark/dirty color, this would indicate the fluid has not been replaced in a long time, which can give some indication to the level of upkeep on the brake system.\nWhen driving the vehicle, the brakes should work good. Whilst the brakes aren\u0026rsquo;t great by today\u0026rsquo;s standards, they do stop the vehicle in a respectable time/distance. Whilst braking, the brake pedal should not feel abnormal. If it pulses, this indicates warped rotors or drums. There should also be no squeals when braking.\nSteering When inspecting the front diff, also pay attention to the tie-rod (joins the wheels together). This can often be damaged/bent when 4wding. Also glance over the ball joints on the ends of all the rods. If any rubber boots have perished, the ball joint itself is probably not far from failure. You can grab the rods and twist them by hand, which will reveal any excessive slop.\nWhen driving the car, the steering should be pretty direct. If it is twitchy, or the car always pulls to one side, this could indicate a bent rod, which puts the wheels out of correct alignment. If the wheel turns more than 10 degrees without the car turning, this indicates worn ball joints or steering coupling (which is in the engine bay). A secondhand tie-rod can be purchased rather cheap. Replacement ball joints vary in price, but average $90 each. A similar problem also occurs if the leaf packs are worn and \u0026lsquo;fanning apart\u0026rsquo;, or bushes/shackles are worn, whereby the wheels can feel like they are wandering when you go around corners. New leafs will cost hundreds of dollars.\nWobbles Whilst Driving This is a big problem with the MQ Patrol, and it is always associated with a worn out component. Often the wheel and king-pin bearings wear out, and allow the road-wheel to shake around on the end of the diff, causing the front end and steering wheel to wobble, often violently. Usually this happens at speed (like 60-80km/hr for example), but in extreme cases the wobbles can start at any speed. Sometimes the steering/car will wobble at all speeds. Other parts of the vehicle can cause this, such as damaged/unbalanced tyres, worn suspension bushes (as discussed above) and broken spring to chassis mounts. If you experience wobbles whilst test-driving, it pays to check out these areas for clues.\nSuspension If the first thing you plan to do to your new car is give it a 2\u0026rdquo; lift kit, then its not really worth checking out the suspension. A lift kit will often include new springs, shocks and all bushings, so everything that may be worn out will be replaced.\nIf you are going to keep the current suspension, then check out each corner, 1 by 1. The leaves should look in good condition, and also be a nice continuous U shape. If they are worn, they will deform into a W shape. The front springs can suffer some damage off-road, so check around the front for breaks or fractures. If you are buying a car that has had a rough life, check that nothing dodgy has been performed to it such as welding broken springs back together.\nCheck all the bushes, as these perish with age. These include in the spring eyes, the ends of the shackles and even the ends of the shock absorbers. Also cast your eye over the shocks, as rocks often damage the tubes and reduce their functionality. You can try pushing down on each corner of the car, and watching the reaction. If it bounces multiple times, the shocks are likely worn.\nBody Rust is a big problem on the MQ Patrol, and every car will have some hiding somewhere. No area is safe from rust, so check thoroughly. Also be on the lookout for dodgy rust repairs with lots of bod.\nThe most common rust areas include;\n The gutters (above the doors, along the sides of the roof). The lower portions of the doors. The sills, under the doors. Around the front windscreen. The area between the bonnet and the windscreen, which often rusts through into the cab and causes leaks. The top of the firewall (often due to the above). Around the radiator, especially the \u0026lsquo;bulge\u0026rsquo; near the transmission mount. The lower portions of the rear quarter panels. The floor, the two most common spots here being  Underneath, around the body mounts. Under the carpet, at the ends of the cross-members the seats bolt to.   In some extreme cases, the chassis can also succumb to rust. The most common area is towards the rear at the round cross-member above the fuel tank.\nMisc There is a lot to check when purchasing a car, and some of it is a bit basic and too general for this article (such as checking lights/electrics and tyres). Here is a quick list of other problem areas you might like to check;\n Door hinges start to sag. The little triangle windows on the front doors leak due to the rubber perishing and the metal channel rusting. Tailgate locks stop working correctly. Tailgate window struts loose their charge and do not support the window. The springs in the seats give way, front and rear. Seat belts may be frayed and not retract properly. Bonnet release cable may stretch and not open the latch sufficiently. Indicators do not cancel correctly.  On the older 24 volt diesels, it is important that the batteries are identical, else there will be charging issues.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Other&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Carburetor Options" data-content="&#34; You may wish to swap the carby on your L28 for a different model, perhaps for better performance, parts availability, or even reliability. Below are some options.\nFitting any different carbs will likely require new fuel and vacuum hoses (perhaps t-pieces etc as well), along with new gaskets.\nSingle Carbs Holley 4-Barrell Arizona Zcar make a reasonably priced 4-barrell manifold (suits square bore carbs). See http://www.arizonazcar.com/manifold.html\nThis manifold would allow the fittment of readily available Holley carbys, such as a 350cfm. Holley carbs do have their own drawbacks when used offroad though. Some additional info can be found on the Engine Conversion wiki page.\nBeing a square-bore manifold, it would also allow direct fitment of dedicated LPG carbys such as the Gas Research Australia Throttle Body Injection. See http://www.gasresearch.com.au/productgoldseries.html\nMulti Carbs All multi carb setups are probably designed to suit Datsun 240z, 260z, 280z (US only), and 280zx (although these are factory EFI). They should fit MQ Patrols without issue, although long setups may get close to inner fender (or second battery tray).\nZeds also have a rod-linkage throttle setup, whereas MQ are cable. Some custom fabricated brackets would most likely be required to connect the cable to the rod-linkages.\nTwin SU Twin SU carbs were standard fitment to Datsun 240z and 260z. They provide good performance, and can be obtained for a fair price second-hand.\nThey are probably ill-suited for use on a 4x4 though. HS type SU carbs have the fuel bowl next to the carb. Gravity keeps the fuel level inside the carb jet level with the fuel inside the fuel bowl. On angles, this level will likely be disturbed, and cause the engine to stall.\n When going up hill, and if the fuel bowl is at the front, fuel will rush into the carb, causing the mixture to become rich and the engine to stall. When going down hill, and if the fuel bowl is at the front, fuel will retreat into the fuel bowl, causing the mixture to become lean. This will likely cause the engine to stall, but lean mixtures can also cause pinging and melted pistons!  &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - L28&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Combo Switch Rebuild" data-content="&#34; Thanks to Seehuusen on Patrol4x4 forum for dontaing the following from his old website.\nThe Problem(s) The indicator had stopped working, and the hi-beams never worked in my car. So I decided to pull it all apart and rebuild the combo switch.\nParts Required  3 prong puller Philips head screw driver De-greaser Teflon Spray or Electrical Grease A bit of fine sand paper  How-To First you pull the steering wheel off, if you have a sports steering wheel like me, then you\u0026rsquo;ll need a puller to get the boss-kit off\nOnce the combo switch is off, you can start pulling it apart. Please use a spot that isn\u0026rsquo;t messy, as there are small parts which can be lost (I actually nearly dropped a little metal ball down the sink).\n Start by degreasing the whole unit, it\u0026rsquo;s going to have a whole heap of crud on it, if this has never been done before (image 1 \u0026amp; 2) Pull the black cover off on the back and un-screw the two screw holding the top assembly to the combo switch (image 3 \u0026amp; 4) give each of the little points a LIGHT sand to get rid of all the oxidation (image 5) re-assemble the headlight part of the combo switch unscrew the 2 screws holding the indicator assembly to the combo switch (image 6) Give that a bit of a sanding and put aside (image 7) Pull out the little bit, still in the combo switch. Be careful when you do this, as there is a spring and a metal ball on the other side, which you DON\u0026rsquo;T want to loose (image 8) This can be pulled apart carefully and given a light sand, put this aside (image 9) Now undo the washer mechanism from the combo switch (image 10 \u0026amp; 11). Again, here is another smaller ball, be careful not to lose it (image 12) give it all a light sanding and re-assemble (image 13) Before re-assembling anything, all electrical parts have been given a spray with this Teflon spray. You can use this (image 14) or electrical grease with no fear of having to do this job again in the near future                                      &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Electrical&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Convert 24 to 12 Volts" data-content="&#34; The SD33 MQ\u0026rsquo;s were all released as 24 volt (standard voltage for trucks). When the MK was released, Nissan changed to 12 volt (standard for passenger vehicles). It is possible to convert a 24 volt vehicle to 12 volt, which allows the use of standard electronics such as spot-lights, amplifiers, alarms etc.\nHere is a walk-through (for further reading): http://www.george4wd.taskled.com/mq2412.html. This page has also been archived as a PDF and can be downloaded.\nAlso refer to the wiki page How to use 12 volt parts with 24 volt vehicle\nEngine Parts The following engine parts will require attention during this conversion.\nEdic Motor This is the electric motor on the engine that changes the mode that the injector pump is in (ie stop, run or start). It will need replacing with a 12 volt unit, second-hand being the only option. It may be possible to re-wind this motor, to work with 12 volt. Alternatively, it can be completely removed and replaced with a cabin-operated cable.\nEngine Controller This unit controls the edic motor and safety features such as stopping the motor upon no oil pressure. If you cannot source a 12 volt edic motor, chances are you will not be able to source a 12 volt version of this either (second-hand is the only option). If you replace the edic motor with a cable, you can probably remove this controller. Before doing this, check if it effects (or is crucial for) the glow plug, starting or charging circuits.\nGlow Plugs Will need replacing with 12 volt units, which can be sourced new for a decent price. Refer to the wiki page on Glow Plugs.\nGlow Plug Relay The glow plugs draw over 30 amps of power, making a relay necessary if you want to keep them operated from extended periods of time (refer to the page on Manual Glowing). Either source a suitable relay, or hard-wire the glow plugs to the batteries, with a heavy-duty switch installed in the cabin. This would make the glow plug timer below not required.\nGlow Plug Timer The timer controls the relay, and runs the glow plugs for set periods of time, depending if the engine is cold etc. To keep the glow plugs \u0026lsquo;automatically\u0026rsquo; controlled, a 12 volt relay and timer will need to be sourced. These could possibly be adapted from other 12v diesel engines, such as the TD42 in the GQ.\nAlternator A special alternator is required for the SD33, as the alternator has an output shaft which drives a vacuum pump. This means a generic/petrol-engine 12v alternator cannot be used, unless an alternative vacuum pump is also used (belt and electric motor driven pumps do exist on the after-market). A genuine MK alternator could be used, or it may be possible to have the 24v alternator re-wound as 12v. It may also be possible to adapt an alternator from another 12v diesel vehicle, as they most likely also have a vacuum pump (you can use GQ TD42!).\nAlternator Voltage Regulator This would only be required if using an MK SD33 12 volt alternator.\nIf using an alternator from a different vehicle, these may have inbuilt or different regulation systems. This would also require a small amount of re-wiring to the existing loom, see the wiki page Alternator with Internal Regulator Conversion\nStarter Motor A 12 volt starter will need to be sourced, or it may be possible to have the 24 volt starter re-wound.\nVehicle/Body Parts The following vehicle/body parts will require attention during this conversion.\nInstrument Cluster The majority of the instrument cluster within an 24 volt vehicle is already 12 volt. This includes the fuel gauge (and in-tank float), oil pressure gauge and water temp gauge.\nThe only part that requires attention is the voltage gauge. This will still detect 12v, however the dial is not accurate at that level (it shows the region of 16 to 32v). It can either be left as-is, or replaced with a 12 volt version. To do this, you could replace just the voltage section of the cluster (a petrol voltage gauge could also probably be inserted) or the whole instrument cluster could be replaced with a MK SD33 item (some feature a tacho!).\nGlobes/Lights Most of the globes will need replacing. These include;\n Head lights Front park lights Front and side indicators Tail lights Rear number plate light Internal roof light Dash notification lights (handbrake, 4wd etc). Heater dial illumination globe.  As mentioned above, the instrument cluster is already 12 volt, and the globes are too. They will not need replacing.\nWindow Wipers The 24 volt wiper motor still works when supplied with 12 volt, although it is too slow to be useful (ultra fast setting will be slower than normal speed). This is unsafe for road use and should be replaced with a 12 volt motor. There are 3 possible methods to achieving this;\n Obtain a 12 volt wiper motor from another MQ Patrol. Units from petrol engines will also work. This is the common solution. It may be possible to have the motor re-wound, to suit 12 volt. A 12 volt motor from a different vehicle (or after-market) may be adaptable.  Window Washer The window washer pump will need to be replaced with a 12 volt pump. Similar to the wiper motor solutions, you could obtain a pump from a 12 volt MQ Patrol (including from petrol vehicles) or purchase an after-market pump. After-market pumps can be purchased with or without new washer bottles.\nHeater Blower Needs changing. Either obtain a 12v MQ unit, have the motor re-wound, or adapt one from a different vehicle.\nWiring Loom All MK have a different wiring loom than MQ, as electronics such as rear window wipers were added. There are even greater differences when comparing a 24 volt SD33 loom with a 12 volt version, due to the different battery/charging circuits. There are 2 options to consider.\nModify Existing Loom In short, in an Australian MQ, the RH battery will need \u0026lsquo;removing\u0026rsquo;, and the LH battery joined to the body (earth). The charging system may require a few minor adjustments. Any 24 volt relays will need replacing (think head light relay etc). There is a 12 volt accessory circuit on the RH battery, the relay operating this will need removing and the circuit joined back into the main loom.\nSwap in New Loom This would be an easier option for someone not competent with car electrics. Simply unplug all engine bay connections and pull the loom through the firewall and into the cab. Then unplug all the dash plugs and the connection to the rear wiring loom (located under the drivers seat), and the old loom can be removed from the vehicle.\nTo aid in installation, you can tag each connector whilst removing the loom and keep a list of the component it connects too. This is not essential, as most components have different plugs, so it is simple to work out what plug connects where.\nAny extra circuits with the new loom can be \u0026lsquo;ignored\u0026rsquo;, they should not effect the functioning of the vehicle.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - SD33&#34;,&#34;Electrical&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Diff Conversions" data-content="&#34; People often ponder if they can \u0026lsquo;upgrade\u0026rsquo; their MQ diffs with units from another vehicle with the most popular candidate being GQ units.\nNo diff from any other vehicle will bolt into an MQ without major modifications!\nThe intent of this page is to describe the hurdles you may face when using diffs from different vehicles (knowledge is power!). It is an \u0026lsquo;overall\u0026rsquo; document, and would apply to any diff such as GQ, Dana or even Unimog. It is not a how-to.\nThings to Consider Diff Pumpkin Location MQ\u0026rsquo;s have a RH droop transfer case, ie the front and rear outputs of the transfer are both on the RH side (Australian drivers side). Both the front and rear diff \u0026lsquo;pumpkins\u0026rsquo; are offset the same, so that the drive shafts are straight. Newer vehicles, such as the GQ, have direct-drive rear outputs on the transfer cases, which come out of the center. This means the rear diffs also have central diff pumpkins, and the front are still offset (to the RH side on GQ). Some American made vehicles, such as Jeeps with Dana diffs, may have the diff pumpkin offset to the LH side.\nHaving an offset transfer output and central diff pumpkin on the rear puts the drive shaft on an angle (when looking from above/below the vehicle). This can cause bad vibrations and lead to premature failure of the uni-joints. Further exaggerating the problem, vehicles with suspension lifts already have an increased drive shaft angle when looking from the side. However, there have been numerous people that have run 4wds with offset transfer &#43; centre diff pumpkin (such as RMP\u0026amp;O on Patrol4x4.com forum) and they have not experienced any problems.\nStud Pattern If you only upgrade 1 diff, and it is a different stud pattern to the original, you would need to carry 2 spare tyres. This would be quite inconvenient.\nBrakes Some diffs may have different chassis-to-diff hoses/setup/locations. On Australian MQ\u0026rsquo;s;\n The master cylinder is on the RH side of the vehicle.\n The front steel brake line passes across the firewall (above the engine), along the top of the LH chassis rail and stops just above the diff. A rubber hose connects the chassis steel hose to a steel hose that runs along the diff. At the ends of the diff mounted steel hose, a rubber hose connects to the brake calipers.\n The rear steel brake line travels along the RH chassis rail. Near the fuel tank, a rubber hose joins to the steel brake line on the diff.\n  The rear diff you upgrade too will likely have brakes better than the MQ drums, or at least equivalent. Be mindful of pressure requirements (ie that your master cylinder is of sufficient size).\nSome newer vehicles also feature the handbrake within the rear disc (basically a mini drum brake inside the disc rotor). You may prefer this over the MQ\u0026rsquo;s transfer mounted drum brake.\nTrack Width Many diffs that are desirable upgrades for the MQ are wider than the stock MQ counterparts. Ensure the final location of your wheels is acceptable in relation to your guards.\nSuspension No matter what diff you are putting into your MQ, you will need to fabricate all new suspension connections to suit your desired setup, which could be leaf sprung under (like stock), leaf sprung over, or coils. Whilst planning such mods, be mindful of the diff pumpkin location, as it may interfere with your pick-up points. Similarly, if you are using diffs from a coil-sprung vehicle and plan to use the mounts it already has, check how these line up suitably with the chassis.\nSteering Other diffs will likely have different ball joint sizes and tie-rod location than the C200 in the MQ\u0026rsquo;s. Consider how you will connect these dissimilar components.\nDrive Shafts Other diffs may have the pinion flanges at a different distance from the axle centreline. This may require your drive shafts to be shortened/lengthened to suit. The flange may also have different bolt centres or count (for example, GQ rear have a larger bolt pattern). Some vehicles may also run a completely different drive shaft to pinion connection, which needs to be considered.\nExample Conversions GQ leaf sprung diffs Jelmer160 from Patrol4x4 has done the conversion.

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Driveline Component Positions" data-content="&#34; Manual Gearboxes The following information is in relation to the manual 4 and 5 speed gearbox with the attached transfer case (T130 model). This is the standard configuration for the majority of MQ and MK vehicles.\nLWB vehicles with the L28 engine used a divorced/seperate transfer case.\nPlease refer to the \u0026lsquo;automatic\u0026rsquo; section of this page for additional information.\nDiagramatic Representation The following picture is not to scale, nor are the locations \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo;. They are to help you visualise the differences only.\n\nGearbox \u0026amp; Transfer L28 has a single part bellhousing. SD33 has a 2 part bellhousing (a \u0026lsquo;ring\u0026rsquo; between the engine and bellhousing, then the bellhousing itself).\nThe engine bolt patterns (and hence the bellhousings) are different. The bellhousing to gearbox bolt pattern is the same, and hence the bellhousings are interchangable (between gearboxes).\nL28 gearboxes (4 and 5 speed) have a 210mm long input shaft. SD33 4 speed gearbox has a 185mm long input shaft. SD33 5 speed gearbox has a 195mm long input shaft. All gearboxes have the same splines, 24 of them and 25.5mm OD. The input shafts are interchangable between gearboxes.\nThe L28 motor is shorter than the SD33. This moves the gearbox forwards in relation to the firewall. The SD33 motor is longer than the l28. This moves the gearbox backwards in relation to the firewall.\nThe motors have different engine mounts, which are in different positions along the chassis. The transfer cases have the same mounts, but they are in different positions along the chassis.\nThe gearsticks of both engines come through the floor in the same position. To achieve this, different top plates are used. The L28 gearsticks are at the back of the gearbox. The SD33 gearsticks are at the front of the gearbox. The top plates are interchangable.\nThe 5 speed gearbox is an \u0026lsquo;upgrade\u0026rsquo; of the 4 speed box. The 5th gear is located within an extension housing that is between the gearbox and transfer. The extension housing is 100mm long, which moves the transfer case and its mounts 100mm further to the rear of the vehicle.\nP40 is the same as SD33.\nDriveshafts All body shapes (ie LWB, SWB and UTE) and their chassis\u0026rsquo; are the same from the front of the vehicle to the end of the front doors. Hence, the front diff is always in the same position in relation to the front of the front of the vehicle. This means the engine and gearbox mounts (for each individual combination) will be in the same position in all vehicles (ie. L28 and 4 speed from SWB will bolt into LWB).\nThe different engine and gearbox combinations result in different front drive-shaft lengths. The different engine and gearbox combinations, as well as the body type/length, results in different rear drive-shaft lengths. Refer to the Factory Driveshaft Lengths wiki page for additional information.\nClutches Refer to the wiki page on Clutches.\nAutomatic Gearbox An automatic gearbox was only available in LWB vehicles with the L28 motor only. This was accompanied by the divorced/seperate transfer case, the T100 model. A small drive-shaft connected the gearbox to the transfer case. 2 unique crossmember (presumably both bolt-in) accompainied this model, one to support the end of the gearbox and the other to support the transfer case.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Gearbox&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="EDIS Electronic Ignition How-To" data-content="&#34; All credit to David_S for creating this how-to in the following thread: http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/fitting-edis-electronic-ignition-p40-l28-engine-38169/\nYou should also read this page in conjunction with Megasquirt How-To and EFI Conversion wiki pages.\nGuide Recently I completed my P40 fuel injection project by doing away with the distributor entirely (well not quite entirely as I have left the old dizzy in place to plug the hole!) and fitting a Ford EDIS (Electronic Distributorless Ignition System) such as can be found on a Falcon EF, though I got my parts from a firm in the UK.\nThe result has been impressive. The engine is much much smoother and pulls better at the higher revs even though I have not yet tuned the advance table, just basing the advance on Nissan specs for the distributor vacuum and rpm (centrifugal) advance. And it is waterproof - I tested it in a bonnet-deep swift water river crossing over the weekend and it did not miss a beat.\nThe system is quite simple. A timing signal from a trigger wheel/VR sensor mounted on the crankshaft goes to an EDIS module, which in turn sends the data to a controller which also receives an engine MAP (manifold absolute pressure) reading. The controller looks up the advance from a MAP/RPM table and sends the info back to the EDIS module which then fires the appropriate coils in a coilpack. It is a \u0026lsquo;waste spark\u0026rsquo; system which fires pairs of plugs simultaneously on both the compression and exhaust strokes (wasting the exhaust stroke spark) so only 3 coils are required. I used the Megasquirt ECU as the controller as it was already controlling my fuel injection and was easy to set up for EDIS, just requiring a couple of jumpers to be soldered in place. You can use other controllers such as megajolt etc but I have not researched these.\n   Info Image     Here is a diagram of the system.    The trigger wheel has 36-1 teeth i.e. has one tooth missing. The changing magnetic field is picked up by a sensor with the \u0026lsquo;missing\u0026rdquo; tooth giving the position of the crankshaft. I mounted the trigger wheel on the back of the crankshaft pulley where it sits quite neatly.    Or from the rear\u0026hellip;    And these are the components\u0026hellip;    And the completed installation in my LHD truck.     Total cost was about $150 (late 2009) excluding the Megasquirt ecu but would be cheaper if you could track down a donor car.\nThis installation was on a P40 engine but there is no reason why it could not fit the L28. There is a lot more information on the Megasquirt site if you are interested.\nQuestions and Answers  How water resistent is the EDIS module and relay board, would the EDIS module be better behind the flywall? EDIS module is a sealed unit with waterproof connector so no need to mount behind flywall. Sensor unit/trigger wheel is unaffected by water. I have tested the setup in very deep water (over bonnet) and it did not miss a beat even though trigger and sensor were under water. But I have the module mounted as high as possible.\nRelay board is mounted in an alloy box ex Dick Smith and is pretty well sealed with mastic. There is a vent pipe leading back into the cockpit to prevent pressure buildup due to sudden temperature changes. Putting the board in the cockpit would really defeat the object of the board which is to act as a collector point for all sensor cables and a power distribution centre with just a single pigtail passing through the firewall to the ECU.  &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - P40&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

You want the single-point injection model, which I think has a \u0026ldquo;3.9\u0026rdquo; badge.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll just pull off the carby and put the ford throttle body injection on in the same place. You might be able to file some bolt holes oval, or you might have to make a small adaptor plate.\nThe fiddliest bit will be running a a second fuel line. Since you have (I think) a spare 60, you will probably be able to put your spare fuel line in next to the original one and it will look pretty close to factory. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember if there\u0026rsquo;s a suitable hole or fitting in the tank to connect the return line to but at worst you could tap into the plate that the fuel level sender is attached to (rather than drilling into the tank itself).\nI definitely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother with multipoint injection from an EF or whatever, it\u0026rsquo;s far too complicated and just tapping the injectors into the inlet manifold is probably very far from optimal anyway.\nThrottle body injection is really just like an electronic carby. Very simple and reliable and more than adequate for this engine. I think you\u0026rsquo;ll find it performs better and is more economical, and if you do take it off-road it will work much better on slopes than the carby does.\nIn answer to someone\u0026rsquo;s previous question, the distributor doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be connected at all, except maybe a signal wire to detect engine speed (can hook to the coil same as you\u0026rsquo;d connect a tacho).\nAs you know I\u0026rsquo;ve just converted the Stag to EFI and it was very, very worth it. Funny thing was I got all the EFI gear for $200, then sold the old holley four-barrel for $220. I don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;ll get $220 for your G60 carby though\nYou could even find an EA on gas and go dual fuel at the same time\n Post by David_S on Mon May 28, 2007 at 10:35 pm  Here\u0026rsquo;s my basic system as I sent to Swerve\nTBI of Falcon EA (4L straight 6) Megasquirt ecu and relay box (see MegaSquirt.info) LC-1 wideband oxygen controller (wideband O2 is essential for tuning) Existing mechanical pump feeding a surge tank which in turn feeds a high pressure external pump to pressurise the injectors (2) CLT sensor (coolant temp) MAT sensor (manifold air temp) TPS throttle position sensor (Part of Falcon tbi) Fuel pressure regulator (Part of Falcon tbi) Air filter box modified from one off a GQ diesel RPM signal from coil\nAt present the megasquirt is set up to control fuel only but once I have it fully sussed I will control spark too with the Megasquirt using input from my distributor (pertronix ignitor) with the vacuum and centrifugal advance locked down.\nAnd yes the first test runs are impressive. Rocketed up a steep fire break on Sunday on all-terrain tyres where previously I ran out of oomph with the carb and struggled. A petrol FJ40 on mudgrips couldn\u0026rsquo;t manage it - he died just where I used to struggle. And the P40 idles happily on a 45 deg slope. No more plug fouling when the carb floods.\nMegasquirt is totally open source so you tune it to your engine with a laptop as you go down the road!\nSome additional comments relating to previous posts.\n1) My surge tank arrangement with external Bosch fuel pump appears to work well. I was not keen to monkey around with an in-tank pump and high pressure lines running the length of my truck. (If you look at the underneath of my truck you will see why!!) With my system I connect the existing LP line 3\u0026frasl;4 the way up a cylindrical 2 litre tank with an outlet at the top which connects to the existing return line to the main tank. The HP pump is located under the surge tank and is fed from the bottom of the surge tank. The return line from the TBI feeds into the top of the surge tank.\n2) The Falcon EA tbi is not a simple bolt on to the existing inlet manifold plate as I believe is possible with the GQ engine (not the P40). I bought a Falcon manifold along with the tbi unit. I cut off the plates from both manifolds and welded the Falcon plate to the Nissan manifold. Needed a fair bit of filing to get a smooth transition. Subsequently I made a 1\u0026rdquo; spacer to raise the tbi unit. This apparently moves the torque curve to the lower rpm end (good) but I did it mainly to make the air filter and throttle cable fit easier. I also fabricated an adapter so I could bolt my carb back on if I had an ecu failure in the back of beyond.\n3) I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother with rail injection and not sure anyway if it would work with 4 runners instead of 6. The tbi unit comes with the fuel pressure regulator built in plus the throttle position sensor (TPS) and a fast idle dc motor which I have hooked up as a hand throttle. Also, and importantly the tbi fuel pressure is only 15 psi compared to the 45&#43; for rail injection.\n4) I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t transplant the ecu from a Falcon or other donor. It is old technology and you can\u0026rsquo;t tune it readily for your own engine. I have the technician notes for the Falcon units and it don\u0026rsquo;t look simple to tune. Requires special equipment. Half the fun of my efi installation is being able to tune it on the road. Additionally the Falcon unit requires a signal from the Ford TFI distributor so you have to get one of these and graft it on to the shaft of your Nissan dizzy.\n5) The Megasquirt ecu is, in my opinion, by far the best unit for diy. 6 months ago I knew nothing at all about efi now I have a working system. There is a very active Megasquirt forum where most of your software and hardware queries can be answered. You can buy fully assembled units or a kit for $US200. I got a kit and my son assembled it for me without difficulty. The Megasquirt can control both fuel and spark. The software is free and open source so you can modify it as much as you like if you want to.\n6) The two most difficult things I contended with were the air filter and the wiring. a) The Falcon air filter was too large and standard Nissan boxes have round holes whereas the Falcon Tbi is oval. In the end I cut the bottom out of a GQ filter box and replaced it with an oval hole.\nb) The wiring is not really difficult, but you have to be methodical, plan routes carefully and keep up to date drawings as you go. I used the Megasquirt relay board mounted in a weatherproof box on the firewall. All wires from sensors, injectors, ignition, 12V source terminate here. The relay board is then connected to the ecu which I have mounted in the glovebox. (I have had water round my feet and coming out the heater vents in river crossings but not yet in the glovebox!) There are around 20 wires connecting the relay board to the ecu which pass through the firewall. Also a vacuum tube (MAP) to connect to the inlet manifold. The Megasquirt incorporates a MAP sensor.\n7) A wideband oxgen sensor and controller is expensive but an absolute MUST for tuning. I use the LC-1 controller ($US200) which so far has worked well. They too have an excellent forum to help with installation and other problems. The wideband controller gives the actual AFR (air fuel ratio) whereas a narrow band just tells you whether the mixture is rich or lean relative to stoichometric (AFR of 14.7). With the wideband you can set up an AFR table in Megatune for every combination of rpm and MAP.\nAs for performance there has been a marked improvement. The engine revs very freely (would probably go to 6000rpm if I let it). There has been a definite power increase. The torque curve appears to have flattened so that it pulls hard between about 1200 and 3000 rpm. And best of all it does not flood on steep hills.\n Pictures from post                                &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - P40&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

Newer engines generally have more power and torque, better economy and greater after-market support, making them excellent replacements. Below is a collection of information relating to the conversions.\nSuppliers The following companies make parts to suit many different conversions.\n Dellow Automotive Castlemine Rod Shop (CRS) Marks 4wd Adaptors They used to make bellhousings, however they no longer do.

A common upgrade to street based motors is the use of a Holley carb, as new models are more advanced than the factory fitted units, providing better power and economy. Holleys (and similar carbs) when used off-road have a problem with the design of the fuel bowls, as hills effect the floats which effects the fuel supply. Often the vehicles will flood and stall on even the slightest of hills. It is recommended that you consider this when choosing a V8 to use in your vehicle. There are a few different options to fuel a V8, and each have their own pros and cons.\nUsing Carby Can mod Holleys but doesnt work very well.\nQuadrajet works good, has different design for fuel supply.\nUsing Straight Gas/LPG Gas is good on hills, no flood etc.\nIf you run out of gas, your stuffed. Plus you don\u0026rsquo;t get the same mileage.\nUsing Gas/LPG and Petrol Good mileage off the petrol, then switch to gas for the hills.\nMore parts, more to go wrong.\nUsing Fuel Injection (EFI) No flood etc.\nExtra electronic components can be a problem with water crossings etc.\nCan covert a carby motor to EFI\n Use after-market components Source the factory components Get a bolt on efi-carb.  Choose the motor in factory EFI form, ie the 350 Chev, 302 Ford and 304 Holdens are all available in EFI.\nMore information on all aspects can be found in this thread http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/wat-v8s-u-guys-running-mq-mk-s-44128/\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Other&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

There were many differnet lengths of driveshaft used, to suit the different length vehicles, transmissions and engine location. The intent of this page is to show locate and identify the various driveshafts.\nPictures of Factory Shafts    Front (2f80b-d) Middle (2s80b) Rear (2f80b)           Measured Lengths The following measurements have been taken from \u0026lsquo;stock\u0026rsquo; vehicles (ie no suspension lifts that would effect the length). They have been taken with the car sitting on flat ground and are from flange-to-flange.\nDrive-shafts are designed to compress and extend whilst in use, and hence these values are just the \u0026lsquo;nominal\u0026rsquo; lengths.\nThe measurements are also for vehicles with the normal H233 rear diff. If you rear diff is the light duty C200 (not used in Australia) or the heavy duty H260, these may have different length pinions and hence different length drive-shafts.\nLastly, the middle/intermediate drive-shaft lengths have been excluded, because it\u0026rsquo;s ambiguous to measure. Use the \u0026lsquo;spider\u0026rsquo; lengths from the service manual below. It can be presumed that a 5 speed middle shaft would be 100mm shorter than the 4 speed.\nIf you have updates or wish to update this table, please post in this Patrol4x4 Thread.\n  Vehicle Specifics Drive-shaft Length (mm)   Motor Body Gears Transfer Front Rear   L28 LWB 4 T100L (Divorced)  980 990   5   Auto   SWB 4 T130A (Attached)  595 745   5 695 645   P40 SD33  LWB UTE  4 670 1290   5 770 1190   SWB 4 670 670   5 770 570    Measurements in RED have been extrapolated by utilising known lengths, the service manual lengths (below) and also the wheelbase differences from Chapter 1 (GI) of the 1980 Service Manuals.\nService Manual Lengths The following 2 tables have been taken from Chapter 12 (PD) of the 1980 Service Manual, and as such they only apply to 4 speed (and automatic) gearboxes. The \u0026lsquo;spider-to-spider\u0026rsquo; lengths refer to the welded sections of tube (and the splice), it does not include the flexible joints and flanges on the ends.\nThe information in these tables is dubious, as it is not known what they are measuring (ie. compressed, nominal or extended length).\nIt has also been noticed that the normal SWB hardtop (normal Australian SWB) has the same drive-shaft lengths as the light duty high-roof hardtop, which has C200 rear. The heavy duty high-roof (H233) has different lengths.\n              &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Gearbox&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

You may need to knock it softly with a hammer to dislodge it.    3.2 Remove the c-clip from the CV, and remove the hub-clutch engagement ring.    3.3 Remove the free-wheel hub sealing ring from inside the \u0026lsquo;hub\u0026rsquo;.    4 Remove the 2x \u0026lsquo;hub\u0026rsquo; to brake caliper retaining bolts.    5 Position and secure the caliper out of the way.    6 Remove the outer 52mm bearing retainer nut from the spindle. You may have to bend/knock the edges of the underlying lock washer to do so.    7 Remove the lock-washer.    8 Remove the inner 52mm bearing retainer nut from the spindle.    9 Pull out the wheel bearing washer.    10 Pull the floating hub with bearings still inside off the spindle, thus exposing the stub axle.     Replace \u0026amp; Repair At this stage, it is also possible to replace the brake discs. If you intend to only repack your existing bearings, skip the steps regarding the bearing cups.\n   Step Info Photo     11 From the back of the hub, remove the seal (lever out with a screwdriver or similar device).    12 Remove the bearings. -   13 From the back of the hub, use a suitable punch/cold chisel and hammer out the small \u0026lsquo;front\u0026rsquo; bearing cup. There are 2 notches in the hub that the chisel can strike through. -   14 From the front of the hub, use a suitable punch/cold chisel and hammer out the large \u0026lsquo;rear\u0026rsquo; bearing cup. There are 2 notches in the hub that the chisel can strike through. -   15 Clean all the old grease out of the hub. -   16 Carefully insert the new bearing cups, with the smaller opening of the cup inserted first.

Torque the bolts to the value specified in the service manuals. -   31 Check that the free-wheel hub engages properly, before lowering the vehicle. -     The bearing cups are a press fit and will require hammering in. Ensure you do not damage the tapered face that the bearing rolls on. One effective method is to use the old bearing cup and place the small opening of the old cup onto the large opening of the new cup. Then strike the old cup with a hammer so that it drives down the new cup. When the new cup is fully seated, the old cup can be knocked out from the other side of the hub, striking its exposed \u0026lsquo;lip\u0026rsquo;. This way, only the old cup is damaged.

Also see Stage 3 (CV) and Stage 4 (Diff Centre).\nThis guide is not exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the relevant section of the Service Manuals such as MQ Service Manual (1980) - Chapter 14 - Front Axle.\nPre-start Warning Before continuing, please understand that a bearing and its cup are a matched pair, even new ones. Using un-matched parts will result in premature bearing failure.\nWhilst working with the king-pins, the bearings could easily become mixed up. It is advisable to mark each king pin (such as \u0026lsquo;left-bottom\u0026rsquo;) and its bearings and cups, to ensure you do not mix the parts up.\nRemove The stages below are for replacing all the parts (ie a rebuild). If you are only repacking the swivel bearings or changing the CV, you will not have to perform every step (such as removing the wiper seal).\n Remove all parts from Stage 1 (Wheel Bearings). Remove the brake backing plate and stub axle, which are both held to the swivel hub by 6 bolts. This will expose the CV. Remove the thrust washer from the end of the CV. Remove the ~10 bolts from the back of the swivel hub, then pull the retainer ring, wiper seal and snap ring off the swivel hub (leave on the diff for now). Remove the top and bottom king-pin bearings and shims (4 bolts each). Manoeuvre the swivel hub from the diff knuckle. You can detach the steering tie-rod if required. Manoeuvre the snap ring and wiper seal over the knuckle and off the diff.  Replace \u0026amp; Repair  Through the top king-pin opening in the diff knuckle, use a suitable punch/cold chisel and hammer out the bottom king-pin bearing cup.\n Do the same for the top bearing cup.\n Clean all the old grease out of the knuckle.\nTo remove the king-pin bearing cups, you will need to remove the CV (with axle) for access. Refer to Stage 3 (CV) for additional instructions. Even if you are not replacing the CV, it is a good idea to re-pack them with new grease, whilst the diff is apart.\n Carefully insert the new bearing cups, with the smaller opening of the cup inserted first.\nThe bearing cups are a press fit and will require hammering in. Ensure you do not damage the tapered face that the bearing rolls on. One effective method is to place something wide and flat over the cup, such as the face of a gimpy. You can then strike the gimpy with a hammer, which will evenly force the bearing cup into the knuckle.\n Remove the bearings from the king-pins.\nThis can be achieved with a bearing puller, or alternatively 2 angles can be placed between the king-pin plate and the bearing, and the king-pin driven out of the bearing.\n Clean all old grease from the king-pin, but leave a tiny smear on the \u0026lsquo;pin\u0026rsquo; to aid bearing installation.\n Attach the new bearings, the the wide end of the bearing going on first.\nThe bearings are a press fit and will require hammering on. Ensure you do not damage the rollers or cage. One effective method is to place the old bearing on top of the new bearing, and strike the old bearing with a hammer. This will push the bearing onto the king-pin and not damage the new bearing.\n Replace the o-ring seal on each king-pin.\n Remove the needle roller bearing from the end of the stub axle. This may be achieved with a bearing puller, although the cage often breaks. Alternatively, the bearing can be knocked out from the other end of the stub axle.\n Pack the new needle roller bearing with grease and insert it. A smear of grease on the outer race will let it slip in easier.\nThe needle roller bearing is a press fit and will require hammering in. Ensure you do not damage the rollers or cage. One effective method is to place something wide and flat over the bearing, such as the face of a gimpy. You can then strike the gimpy with a hammer, which will evenly force the bearing into the stub axle.\n  Assemble  Manoeuvre the wiper seal and snap ring over the knuckle and onto the diff. Apply a light film or grease to the outside of the steering knuckle and the inside of the swivel hub. Manoeuvre the swivel hub onto the diff knuckle. If you removed the tie-rod, torque the ball joint to the value specified in the service manual. Attach the top and bottom king-pin bearings and shims (4 bolts each). Use equal amounts of shims on the top and bottom. Torque the bolts to the value specified in the service manual. Check that the swivel hub can move without excessive force being applied. Adjust the shims to suit. Attach the snap ring, wiper seal and retainer ring to the back of the swivel hub. Torque the ~10 bolts to the value specified in the service manual. Adjust the steering stop bolt to suit. Apply grease to the thrust washer and put onto the CV. Refer to the service manuals for the correct orientation of the chamfered edge. Lightly grease the surface of the CV. Attach the stub axle and brake backing plate to the swivel hub. Torque the 6 bolts to the value specified in the service manual.

It continues on from Stage 1 (Wheel Bearings) and Stage 2 (Swivel Hubs). Also see Stage 4 (Diff Centre).\nThis guide is not exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the relevant section of the Service Manuals such as MQ Service Manual (1980) - Chapter 14 - Front Axle.\nIt is possible to upgrade the CV\u0026rsquo;s with the version from the GQ Patrol. Please refer to wiki page GQ CV Conversion.\nRemove  Gain access to the CV by removing sufficient parts from Stage 1 (Wheel Bearings) and Stage 2 (Swivel Hubs).\nThere are 2 \u0026lsquo;methods\u0026rsquo; to achieving this;  Remove the floating hub assembly and stub axle from the face of the swivel hub. This will require re-adjusting the wheel bearings. Remove the king-pins, wiper seals and tie rod for the swivel hub, and remove it (with floating hub etc still attached) as one component.  Carefully withdraw the CV and axle assembly.  Replace \u0026amp; Repair The CV is restrained on the axle by 2 c-clips. One stops the CV sliding too far down the axle, the other stops the CV sliding off the axle. The latter clip can be considered \u0026lsquo;disposable\u0026rsquo; as it is often damaged when removing the CV. New CV\u0026rsquo;s are usually supplied with a replacement c-clip.\nThere are many methods to remove the CV from the axle, but the easiest is the pipe trick, as seen on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a80bXtr5hyE. Similarily, you can also use something like an angle to achieve the same results.\nIt can be rather difficult to remove the CV from the axle if it is clipped on, especially if you are attempting an \u0026lsquo;emergency\u0026rsquo; replacement in the bush. It is possible to leave the clip off the end of the axle, so the CV can be removed by hand. This can cause another problem though, as the axle can now move further towards the diff centre. This can cause the raised surface of the axle to loose contact with the centre seal, causing the diff oil to leak into the axle tubes and out through the knuckle seals, which can wash away the CV grease. To remedy this, the axle can be martac\u0026rsquo;d. A word of warning, if you martac an axle and later change your diff centre (ie to a locker), the martac may be in the wrong location and cause more problems.\nGenerously pack the CV with grease prior to attaching to the axle. If you are using the c-clip, put it on the axle and then push the CV onto the axle, over the top of the clip (causing it to compress within the groove).\nAssemble  Carefully insert the axle and CV assembly into the diff housing. Gently manoeuvre the axle so that it slides through the inner diff seal and into the diff centre. Using too much force can damage the diff seal. Pressing down on the CV will \u0026lsquo;lever\u0026rsquo; the end of the axle up, helping to get it through the centre. Re-assemble the components removed from Stage 2 (Swivel Hubs) and Stage 1 (Wheel Bearings).  &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Differential&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

Refer to Stage 3 (CV). Remove the diff centre drain plug and drain the old oil.\nWhenever draining diff or gearbox oil, it is advisable to check that the fill plug can be removed before draining the oil. If you drain the oil and later find that the fill plug is seized and cannot be removed, you will be in trouble. Remove the diff breather hose (2 hose clamps, one on the diff cover, other on the axle tube). Remove the diff cover (~10 bolts). If you intend to replace the pinion seal, remove the driveshaft (4 bolts). Remove the left and right bearing caps (2 bolts each). When installing the caps, they must be installed the same way they were removed. So label the left and right caps, and the inner and outer faces, before proceeding. Remove the left and right bearings and shims. Again, remember the order and orientation. Remove the diff centre by manoeuvring it carefully from the housing. Remove the large nut holding the flange for the driveshaft to pinion. Withdraw the pinion.  Replace \u0026amp; Repair This section is unfinished.

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Fuel Filters" data-content="&#34; Banjo Filter (Primary) The first filter in the stock system is located within a banjo bolt on the lift pump. The fuel being drawn from the chassis fuel line is first filtered by this small filter. It can clog up rather easily, which will cause an engine to run extremely bad, if at all. Many owners are unaware of its existence and often wonder why their vehicle doesn\u0026rsquo;t run properly even after replacing the obvious canister filter discussed below. These images detail the location of the banjo filter. Below you can see an example of a clogged filter and pipe, as what they should look like when clean. Pictures courtesy of Patrol4x4 user vanderbro http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/687669-post1167.html\n                There are many ways to clean the filter. Submersing in petrol or spraying with brake or carby cleaner should easily clear out any crud. Whilst spraying with compressed air would also clean it, you may damage the filter itself, so proceed with caution.\nLift pump part info (banjo filter is item 21): \nCanister Filter (Secondary) Was installed by the factory in a rather useless position, as the banjo filter has already blocked up with all the large debris before it reached the canister filter. It does filter out a lot of the finer particles that would pass through the rather course banjo filter.\nCanister filter part info: \nAdding an Extra Filter To prevent the banjo filter from clogging up, some people put a filter in the rubber hose that connects the chassis fuel line to the banjo bolt. This filter will then relieve the stock filters of their filtering duties, hence preventing them (especially the banjo filter) from becoming blocked.\nStock fuel lines (extra filter should be installed on fuel line #7): \nAdditional Info  SD Series Diesel Engine Service Manual - SD33T Supplement - Chapter 05 - Engine Fuel  &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - SD33&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="GQ Body Parts Compatibility" data-content="&#34; The GQ (Y60 series) body has many similarities with the MQ, as it is basically an upgrade of the MQ. This results in many parts being compatible between both models. This page aims to identify all the components and explain their similarities/differences.\nBody Shells Compatibility: Extensive Mods Required\nThe GQ body are similar size to MQ bodies (length, width and height). The chassis are vastly different though, in order to accommodate coil spring suspension and different drivelines. This means the body to chassis connections are in different locations, therefore they will not bolt directly to an MQ chassis.\nFront and Rear Bars Compatibility: Mods Required\nThe GQ chassis are different width. The bars will not bolt up without mods (attachment tabs could be cut-off and welded on in the correct locations).\nBonnet Compatibility: Compatible\nThe bonnets have the same overall size. The GQ bonnet have different window washer nozzles (2 compared to 1), but these could easily be catered for. It has been confirmed that the bonnet hinges are different, but does this effect the bonnet to hinge bolts?\nFront Panels Compatibility: Compatible\nThe GQ fenders will bolt onto an MQ, however they will not align with the MQ or MK grille, as the GQ has integrated indicators. Therefore the GQ grille would also need to be used, however they only have 7\u0026rdquo; round lights, making the conversion harder for MK. It is unknown if the hole for the 7\u0026rdquo; lights in the GQ grille line up with the MQ lights. Further to this, the GQ grille does not have a steel panel below it like the MQ, so this would need removing. FYI, The steel panel between the windscreen and bonnet are not compatible. the wiperblades are further apart on the gq.\nAlso refer to GQ Front Bodywork Swap\nWindscreen Compatibility: Compatible\nThe GQ windscreen is exactly the same size and is possible to interchange, including the rubber seal.\nFront Doors Compatibility: Compatible\nThe GQ doors are the same shape externally, however they have side-intrusion bracing within the door. Minor add-on parts such as weather seals and locks are compatible between both.\nFront Door Glass Compatibility: Compatible\nThe GQ has a style of window that covers the whole opening, unlike the MQ that has the triangle quarter vent. All the associated parts from a GQ door (winder, glass, winder, runner channels etc) will bolt into an MQ door.\nFront Door Mirrors Compatibility: Mods Required\nDue to the different window designs, GQ have different mirror designs than MQ. There are 2 common designs, one that bolts into the corner of the window, the other has 2 bolts to the door. The GQ door mounted mirrors have different bolt centres compared to MQ. The difference however is only a few mm, so the holes in the mirror can be slotted.\nElectric Window Winders Compatibility: Unknown\nOne would presume these are compatible, as the doors share the same dimensions.\nLWB Back Doors Compatibility: Unknown\nNot the rear barn doors, but the doors for the rear passengers. There may be some difference in shape around the rear wheel well (or bulges added for flares). Even if the doors are different shape, are the handles, windows and weather seals compatible?\nLWB Side Windows Compatibility: Compatible\nThe ones in the cargo area interchangeable (source).\nSWB Canopy Side Windows Compatibility: NOT Compatible\nGQ are a different size.\nRear Barn Doors Compatibility: Unlikely Compatible\nThe following is applicable to MQ LWB vans only, as LWB wagons have tailgates. MQ vans have a \u0026lsquo;60-40\u0026rsquo; split rear door, whereas GQ are \u0026lsquo;50-50\u0026rsquo;. This means that locks and latches on the body will be in different spots. It is unknown if the hinges are the same or compatible. It is unknown if the overall height and width of the door opening are the same. If you intend to use GQ doors on your MQ, you should make extensive measurements before committing yourself!\nRear Windscreens Compatibility: NOT Compatible\nAll GQ have barn doors, so the rear windscreens are not same as MQ\u0026rsquo;s tailgate versions. This excludes MQ LWB vans, as these have barn doors. Due to the different \u0026lsquo;split\u0026rsquo; sizes, it is highly unlikely the windows are the same size.\nRoof Racks Compatibility: Possible\nPresume LWB are compatible, as they simply fit to the gutters. Presume SWB are not compatible, as the GQ rear canopy is part of the body (hence the steel gutters are continuous).\nHead Lights Compatibility: Possible\nGQ have standard 7\u0026rdquo; headlights, so these should be compatible with MQ only.\nTail Lights Compatibility: NOT Compatible\nThis is not confirmed, however the GQ probably have wider rear guards, making the lights different shapes, hence they will not fit into the MQ hole very well.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Body&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="GQ Brake Parts Compatibility" data-content="&#34; GQ Patrols share a similar brake system to the MQ. This page aims to identify all the components and explain their similarities/differences.\nFront Brake Calipers Single Piston Compatibility: Most parts are interchangable.\nThe majority of GQ and MQ use the same single-piston sliding calipers, and as such use the same brake pads. The complete caliper is not a direct swap though, as the \u0026lsquo;cages\u0026rsquo; have different offsets to suit the different swivel hubs. The cages can be swapped though, so the \u0026lsquo;working-parts\u0026rsquo; are compatible.\n\nFront Brake Pads Compatibility: Compatible\nDue to the calipers being identical, the brake pads are also identical.\nFront Brake Discs Compatibility: Compatible\nThese are the same size, thickness, and have the same bolt pattern to the swivel hub.\nMultiple Piston Compatibility: (Probably) Not Compatible\nThe twin piston calipers (and rotor?) from a GQ/GU Patrol can be swapped with the single piston calipers also from a GQ. Because of the caliper cage offset difference mentioned above, the twin piston calipers will likely not fit correctly on MQ, but could easily be corrected.\nThe following thread contains some information on the swap with regards to a GQ: http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-gq-y60-ford-maverick-11/bra\u0026hellip;\nFour piston calipers are available on some GU Patrols. These can be swapped with the GU twin piston calipers. From this, we can assume they would have the same problems if attempted to fit to a MQ.\nRear Brakes Drum Rear Some GQ feature drum disk on the rear. It is unknown if these are the same as MQ units. According to the following thread, the GQ disc brake rear end cannot be swapped onto the GQ drum brake diff. The whole diff needed changing.\nhttp://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-gq-y60-ford-maverick-11/drum-disk-conversion-23424/\nDisc Rear Compatibility: Not Compatible\nMany GQ feature disc brakes on the rear, whereas the MQ are drum. The parts are not easily swapped (ie they are NOT a bolt-on proposition). Refer to the rear disc brake conversion wiki page for more info.\nMaster Cylinder Compatibility: Compatible\nThe GQ master cylinder has a bigger bore than its MQ counterparts (24.5mm vs 23.1mm). It also features different outlet locations and reservoir bottle. Regardless of these difference, it bolts onto the MQ with only the simplest of mods, and provides better performance at the same time. It is a worth-while upgrade.\nBrake Booster Compatibility: Mods Required to Fit\nThe GQ master cylinder is a dual-servo type, providing better braking feel/performance. It is also a smaller diameter than the MQ counterpart, but is longer (from the firewall). It can be adapted easily into the MQ, however the master cylinder may hit the battery tray. This could require a notch to be cut in the tray.\njclures on Patrol4x4 has done the conversion, and provided the following information.\n It was not difficult to fit, the four mounting bolts on the GQ booster had to be shortened and the actuator rod also had to be shortened as well, but neither was a problem. It only just fits in my Nissan as I have relocated the battery carrier, but it should not be a problem to fit in any other Nissan MQ/MK.\n See the thread for a full discussion: http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/my-mk-nissan-rear-disk-brake-conversion-19820/index2.html\nHandbrake Compatibility: Unlikely Compatible\nBoth models feature mechanically operated drum brakes fitted to the rear of the transfer cases, which work as the hand brake. Due to each model using different driveline components, it is unlikely that the parts are interchangable. Handbrakes cables may be compatible, however GQ is likely longer (due to a longer gearbox&#43;transfer assembly). It is unknown if the pads and drum itself are the same.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Brakes&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="GQ CV Conversion" data-content="&#34; Facts  A standard GQ (Y60) CV is considered stronger than a standard MQ CV.\n The GQ CV is slightly larger than an MQ CV, though it is small enough to fit inside both the MQ diff knuckle and stub-axle.\n The spline from CV to axle is the same on both GQ and MQ.\n The spline from CV to hub is larger on the GQ.\n Manual hubs from a GQ (with their larger splines) are interchangeable with MQ hubs.\nTechnically, the drive clutch ring is the only piece that needs swapping. The switch housings are the same.\nAftermarket GQ hubs are considered to be weak. GQ owners recommend the factory Nissan hubs be used.\n Automatic hubs from a GQ are considered to be weak, and GQ owners often upgrade to manual hubs. It is not advisable to use automatic hubs for this conversion. Compatibility is unknown, but presumed okay.\n  Parts Required To do the conversion, you will require the following parts (recommended);\n Standard GQ CV, these can be purchased new from eBay for ~$50 AUS each.\n Nissan GQ manual hubs. The majority of a GQ manual hub is the same as an MQ hub, it is only the \u0026lsquo;drive clutch\u0026rsquo; ring that differs. New from Nissan, the complete hubs cost $800&#43; and the clutch rings on their own cost $300&#43;, therefore it is advisable to source some second-hand hubs. They can be hard to locate though, as they are also sought after by GQ owners.\n  Install The method to swap a CV is explained on the following wiki page: Front Diff Rebuild - Stage 3 (CV).\nIn addition, the following also needs to be considered.\n There is a c-clip on the end of the axle that retains the CV, this should be left off. Often the GQ CV &#43; MQ axle length is slightly different to MQ CV &#43; MQ axle, and this may cause the steering to bind. Leaving the end c-clip off will allow the axle to slide in/out more. This does have some downfalls though, which are discussed in the \u0026lsquo;Replace \u0026amp; Repair\u0026rsquo; section on the Front Diff Rebuild - Stage 3 (CV) page.\n When putting the GQ hub-clutch engagement ring onto the end of the CV, the c-clip cannot be used to retain it any more as the groove in the GQ CV does not line up correctly. This should not cause any problems.\n  \n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Differential&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="GQ Diff Compatibility" data-content="&#34; A commonly asked question is \u0026ldquo;Can I use GQ diffs in my MQ?\u0026rdquo;. The simple answer is NO, they will not bolt in. Like anything though, they could be fitted with substantial fabrication and associated work, much like you could fit a jet engine in the boot if you wanted.\nThe intent of this page is to describe the mixing and matching of parts between MQ and GQ diffs, not how to fit the diffs into a MQ. This will be covered by the (non-specific) Diff Conversions wiki page.\nFYI, H233 diff was used in most MQ and probably even MK models. It is not known for certain if H233B were available in MK Patrols, but there are reports they were. It may be that the very last models of MK used the H233B, in preperation for the release of the GQ / Y60. If you need to indentify your diff, refer to the table on Diff Info wiki page.\nFront Diff (H233B - 31 Spline) The front diff in MQ\u0026rsquo;s is the C200 model and the GQ uses a H233B model.\nThird Member Compatibility: Varies\nThe GQ front diff is a banjo type with removable third member. As such, the ring, pinion, and diff centres are not compatible with the C200 salisbury type diffs.\nSome parts are compatible with the H233/H223B rear diff of MQ patrols though, as discussed below. In addition, the third member will bolt into a MK H233B with no modifications. It will not bolt into a H233 due to the different bolt pattern and depth (pinion ~4cm longer).\nNo parts are compatible with the H260 rear.\nRing and Pinion Compatibility: Depends\u0026hellip;\nRegardless of compatibility, the GQ R\u0026amp;P will be reverse cut to suit a front differential. It would not be recommended to use one within a rear diff.\nThe R\u0026amp;P will swap into a MK H233B rear third member. They will not bolt into a H233 diff, due to different bolt size and PCD to the centre, also the pinion are ~ 4cm longer.\nCentres (LSD/Lockers) Compatibility: Compatible\nThey are entirely compatible with a MK H233B rear diff. They are not directly compatible with a H233 diff, due to different bolt patterns to the ring.\nCentres (Lokka/Mini-Spool) Compatibility: Compatible\nThese lockers replace the spider gears within an open centre. They are entirely compatible with a MK H233B rear diff. They should be compatible with a H233 diff.\nAxles Compatibility: Not Compatible\nA GQ diff is wider than an MQ diff, which means the axles are longer. They also have more splines to the centre. Hence, they are not compatible.\nCV Compatibility: Compatible\nA standard GQ CV can be used in a C200 front diff, but the GQ free-wheel hub must also be used. Please refer to the [GQ CV Conversion][Wiki: gq cv] page.\nSwivel Hubs Compatibility: Compatible\nGQ swivel hubs can be used on C200 diff knuckles, as the king-pins are the same size. According to this Outerlimits4x4 thread, there are some minor differences with steering geometry. Also, the brake caliper mounts are offset from the wheel slightly different.\nOn an MQ, the tie rod connection points are located mid-height and at the front of the swivel hub. On a GQ, they are located down low and behind the swivel hub. This is considered an undesirable trait of the GQ swivel hubs and some people actually change to the MQ system for better clearance (as discussed in the Outerlimits4x4 thread linked above). The tapered hole for the tie rod studs are the same size on MQ and GQ.\n\nBrakes Compatibility: Compatible\nRefer to the GQ Brake Parts Compatibility page for info.\nRear Diff (H233B - 33 Spline) MQ\u0026rsquo;s feature many different models of rear diff, being the C200, H233 and/or H233B in MK, and H260 models. H233 (&#43;B) are the most common rear diff used in Australia, whereas European countries often have the C200. H260 is reserved for heavy duty applications.\nThe GQ also feature H260 in the rear of some heavy duty models, however they mostly have H233B rear differentials.\nThe following will compare the H233 (&#43;B) found in the rear of MQ\u0026rsquo;s to the H233B found in the rear of GQ\u0026rsquo;s.\nNo parts from the rear of any GQ will be compatible with a rear C200.\nMost parts from the rear of a H260 should be compatible (including lockers and LSD), the exception being axles due to different lengths.\nThird Member Compatibility: Not Compatible\nThe H2** series diffs are all banjo style, and the third member is the pinion, ring, and centre combined assembly that bolts into the axle housing. The complete third member assembly is not compatible, for a few reasons, including;\n The ring gear bolt size and PCD is different on a H233B compared to a H233. The ring would swap into a MK H233B though. Pinion flange bolted connection (to the drive shaft) are wider bolt centres on GQ. More splines for the diff centre on GQ rear H233B than any MQ H233 (&#43;B). Diff centres (including all types of diff locks) as mentioned have more splines and different bolts. This means a GQ rear diff lock cannot be used in an MQ!  Axles Compatibility: Not Compatible\nA GQ diff is wider than an MQ diff, and the \u0026lsquo;pumpkin\u0026rsquo; is located in the centre on GQ (offset to RH side on MQ). Further to this, the centre splines are larger on GQ.\nBrakes Compatibility: Not Compatible\nGQ feature disc brakes on the rear, whereas MQ are only drum. Refer to the GQ Brake Parts Compatibility page for further info.\nBearings Compatibility: Unknown\nIt is not know if the bearings and seals located at the wheel ends of the diff housing are the same.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Differential&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

It cannot be connected to the MQ chassis without modifications. This requires new holes drilled and sleeves welded within the MQ chassis.\nSteering Column Compatibility: Unknown\nIt is unknown whether the GQ steering column can be used in the MQ, although it is presumed it can be. The splines at the steering box end are the same.\nSteering Damper Compatibility: Unknown\nSwivel Hubs Compatibility: (Probably) Compatible\nGQ owners occasionally replace with their swivel-hubs with those from an MQ, therefore it should be possible to use GQ swivel-hubs on an MQ. The GQ swivel hubs locate the tie rod behind the diff and lower than the centre, which is why they upgrade to MQ swivels (to move the tie rod to a higher and safer location, basically a cheap hi-steer).\nTie Rod Compatibility: Not compatible\nThe GQ tie rod is longer than the MQ.\nUni-Joint Compatibility: Compatible\nThe GQ \u0026lsquo;uni-joint\u0026rsquo; that joins the steering column to steering box is beefier than the MQ.

The photos specifically apply to a GQ, but the process is near identical to an MQ.\nThe following steps and photos are much the same as the wheel bearing swap guide at Front Diff Rebuild - Stage 1 (Wheel Bearings).\nPreperation    Step Info Photo     1 Get the parts you need. Refer to this wiki page.    2 Get the tools you need. You may need a 52mm socket for removing the lock nuts.     Dismantle    Step Info Photo     3 Remove the freewheeling hub.\nNothing difficult here just undo the six bolts with an 8mm hex bit and ratchet. There is also no need to remove the wheel.    4 Remove the hub locating ring.    5 Remove the circlip.    6 Remove the freewheeling clutch gear (slides off).    7 Straighten out the lockwasher tab for the outer locknut.\nYou can see the tab on the left of the nut. I used a pin punch and hammer to flatten it out.    8 Remove the outer nut.\nI had bought the hub socket so used that but it was not really necessary as the nut was only hand tight and a couple of taps with the pin punch and hammer would have loosened it.    9 Remove the lock washer.\nI found this the most frustrating as it kept getting jammed on the thread and there\u0026rsquo;s really not a lot of room to get hold of it. Using a magnetic pickup and long nose pliers for one side it came relatively easily but the other I had to get a small screwdriver to lever it out.    10 Remove the inner nut. No photo, same as #8.    Install    Step Info Photo     11 Put the GU locknut on. Torque to 120 lb/fts.    12 Put the lock washer on.\nYou need to have it so that holes in the washer line up with the two threaded holes in the locknut. So you may have to take it back off and tighten the locknut some more.    13 Put the two screws in.\nI put low strength thread locker on these as probably not a good idea for them to come loose. The standard nissan ones are 4mm x 6mm phillips cheese head set screws really easy to strip the head. I\u0026rsquo;m going to find some hex socket head set screws to replace them.    14 Put the freewheeling hub locator in.    15 Put the freewhelling clutch gear on.    16 Replace the circlip. No photo.   17 Replace the freewheeling hub outer.     Additional MQ Specific Information Installation tips were provided by Patrol4x4 user DiscoMuzz in this thread: http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/mk-front-hub-rebuild-help-needed-please-55756/\n The GU locking ring comes with two locating tabs. If you use it on a MQ you may need to file one of the tabs off. The ring is a pin type. You will need to buy or make a spanner to tighten correctly, although the mechanic at the local dealer reckons he just uses the old screw-driver-in-the-hole-and-whack-it method to get tension (by the way, the correct torque is 120ft/lbs or TWICE the torque of your standard wheel nut - have fun) which is what I did. So, its ring, lock and then screw it together.\n &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Differential&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="GU Lock Ring Conversion - Parts Required" data-content="&#34; The Problem MQ uses 2 large nuts with a thin-flat washer in between, The washer has grooves to keep it in position, and is folded over the nuts to keep them captive. Unfortunately, it often fails, and either the tabs are ripped out of the grooves, or the folds un-fold. This allows the nuts to loosen, and eventually you get bad wheel shakes.\nThe Solution GU Patrols use 1 nut, with threaded holes in its circumfrence. The tabbed-locking washer is much thicker, also with holes in its circumfrence. Once the wheel bearings are torqued, small screws are used to connect the washer and nut together, locking the nut in position. As long as the screws remain in place (maybe with a bit of locktight to help), the wheel bearings should stay nice and tight.\nParts Needed These are the part numbers required if you want to buy brand new from Nissan.\n   Part Nissan Part Number ~ Price (AUD 2010) Quantity Needed     Lock Nut 40262-02J10 $11.61 each 2   Lock Washer 40264-02J10 $8.12 each 2   Screws 01414-00051 ~$4 each 4    \nInstallation Refer to the \u0026lsquo;How To\u0026rsquo; wiki page for detailed instructions with pictures.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Differential&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

This means all the power to the headlights has to run through the switch, which can cause them to become hot and in extreme cases melt. The factory wiring is also rather thin, which limits the current available to the headlights, meaning you arent getting the best possible light from your headlights.\nThe headlight circuit can be cheapily and easily upgraded, as show in the diagram below. The headlight wiring will run from the firewall down the RH side of the car. Simply cut the red with trace wires at a suitable location. Join these wires to the new relay terminals, then replace the rest of the wiring with new and heavy gage.\nTo perform this mod, you will require the following parts;\n Heavy duty wire of suitable amps (probably 20 for high beam). Using 3 different colors will keep your wiring logical, such as;  Dark Yellow for the high beam circuit. Light Yellow for the low beam circuit. Can be lower gage (maybe 15A). Black for the earth. Needs to be equivalent gage to high-beam wiring.  2 relays Fuse holder. In-line and waterproof ones are good for this. Alternativley, relays can be purchased with fuses attached, but these must be mounted very close to the battery. Optional- You can buy new plugs for the headlights, to save re-using the old corroded ones. Various crimp joints and tape etc.  \nFaults and Repairs Below are some common problems and causes. When fault-finding, check the causes in the order shown, as they are the most common and you should always check the easiest things first.\n  Problem Cause   Dim Lights Low voltage. Corroded connections to headlight. Bad\\Corroded earth. Faulty circuit in wiring or switch.   No Lights Blown fuse. Broken switch. Bad earth. Broken wiring. Broken blobes.   One Light **(High OR Low)** Off or Flickering or Dim Corroded power plug\\wire at light. Partially broken globe. Faulty wiring on the lights individual wire (between the light and the &#39;fork&#39;).   One Light **Always** Off or Flickering or Dim Corroded earth at light plug. Faulty wiring on the lights individual wire (between the light and the &#39;fork&#39;).    Important note regarding blown fuses.\nFuses vary rarely fail on their own. A fuse is a safety device, it is designed to blow when the wiring circuit is taken beyond its capacity (ie if the wiring can only handle 12Amps max, a 10Amp fuse would normally be used). If your fuse has blown, it is because there is a problem elsewhere in the circuit. This would normally be a faulty component (ie headlight) or a short in the wiring. Never replace a fuse without checking the circuit first. Never replace a fuse with a higher rated fuse Doing so can cause the wiring to overheat and burn, along with your vehicle!\nIf your fuse and fuse holder have started to melt, this indicates your circuit is at max capacity. In this scenario, it is advised to upgrade your wiring as detailed above.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Electrical&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="How to use 12 volt parts with 24 volt vehicle" data-content="&#34; All MQ\u0026rsquo;s with the SD33 engine were released as 24 volt. This poses many problems, as almost all after-market electronics for vehicles are 12 volt. This page discusses how to safely run 12 volt parts on a 24 volt vehicle.\nWhen the MK was released, Nissan changed the SD33 to 12 volt. It is possible to convert a 24 volt vehicle to 12 volt. Please refer to this wiki page.\nThe MQ 24 Volt Circuit The MQ uses 2 standard 12 volt batteries wired in series to create 24 volt. On an Australian MQ, the following connections exist;\n The negative of the RH (low) battery is the earth for the vehicle, this connects to the chassis and engine etc.\n The positive of the RH battery is connected to the negative of the LH side battery, to create the series connection.\n The positive of the LH (high) battery supplies 24 volt power to the vehicle.\n  It is possible to \u0026lsquo;tap\u0026rsquo; 12 volt power from the positive terminal of the \u0026lsquo;low\u0026rsquo; (RH) side battery. The standard 24 volt MQ wiring loom uses this connection to power the radio, cigarette lighter and dash.\nProblems With The Standard System Taking 12 volt from the low battery, as described above, causes the low battery to drain faster than the high battery. This is because it is supplying power to both the 12 and 24 circuits.\nThis shows a flaw with the charging system, as the batteries require different charge rates. However, the alternator only \u0026lsquo;sees\u0026rsquo; 1 battery (ie the 2*12 volt batteries appear as 1*24 volt) and supplies charge to suit. This will cause the low battery to remain under-charged and eventually become flat.\nThe factory 12 volt circuit runs very few components, which draw very little power. Their effect on the batteries charge is minimal and acceptable. However, if extra 12 volt equipment (stereos, spot lights etc) are run from this circuit, this will become a very real problem.\nSolutions Apart from converting the entire vehicle to 12 volt (refer link at start), there are 3 viable solutions. They are shown in increasing order of power supply (ie small to large supply). The cost of a solution will also increase as your power requirements increase.\n24 to 12 volt Converter These units have 24 volt inputs, so they draw power from both batteries equally. They then convert the power down and output 12 volts. Any 12 volt parts are then run directly from the converter. They require a \u0026lsquo;closed loop\u0026rsquo; circuit, which means the earth/negative must return from the part to the converter through a wire (similar to wiring a speaker).\nThere are many options available on the after-market. Dick Smith sell a few smaller units and Red-Arc make many sizes (including rather large ones).\nThis solution is best suited for running only a few small parts, such as a CD player and a CB radio. Running too many or too large appliances will often cause a safety switch to trip within these units.\nThese units are best run from a switch-able circuit, such as the accessory circuit. If they are run directly from the batteries and left on, they will continue to drain power even when the car is not in use, resulting in 2 flat batteries.\nOne down-side to consider, turning the unit off will cause parts such as CD players to loose their memory. A workaround is to hook the \u0026lsquo;memory\u0026rsquo; wire of the unit directly to the low battery \u0026lsquo;tap\u0026rsquo; circuit. Whilst this will technically cause the batteries to become unevenly charged, it will only be by a minute amount.\nCharge Equaliser These units address the problem of the low battery being undercharged when tapping power from it. Similar to the converter, they take 24 volt power and convert it down to 12 volt. This power is then used to charge the low battery. They are in essence an alternator for the low battery only.\nCharge equalisers are available from companies such as Red-Arc.\nHigher current draw parts can be used with this system, compared to the converter system. Unlike the converter, any 12 volt parts do not need to have \u0026lsquo;closed-loop\u0026rsquo; wiring, the earth can return through the chassis. This allows simpler wiring circuit(s).\nNew 12 volt Circuit This solution will provide the most power for your 12 volt parts, but is the most complex. It requires a second alternator (12 volt) to be added to the motor and a third battery added to the vehicle.\nThis system has to be wired in a \u0026lsquo;closed loop\u0026rsquo;, which means that all 12 volt earth/negatives need to run through wires back to the battery. You cannot earth to the body/chassis, as this is part of the 24v system. If an ignition or accessory circuit is required for the new 12 volt system, this can be achieved through the use of relays that are connected to the relevant 24 volt circuit.\nThe third battery would also provide additional benefits;\n Fridges etc could drain the 12v battery flat and would not effect the 24v system, so you could still start the vehicle.\n The third battery could be temporarily hooked up to a winch to provide additional power.\n If damage occurred to one of the 24v batteries, or even to a friends vehicle, you have a \u0026lsquo;spare\u0026rsquo; available.\n  &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - SD33&#34;,&#34;Electrical&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Identifying Vehicle Shakes" data-content="&#34; Shaking in the MQ is a common problem and can be caused by many different things, including;\n Wheel bearings (wheel or king-pin/swivel) Worn steering components Worn suspension components Unblanaced or \u0026lsquo;egged\u0026rsquo; wheels/tyres Damaged driveline  To pin-point the cause of the shakes, it is necessary to identify the true nature of shake, by asking what is shaking and when does it shake? Once answered, the following can be used to identify which parts of the vehicle are most likely to be causing the shakes.\nShakes whilst increasing speed.  If the shaking is felt in the steering wheel, check;\n Ball joints of the steering components. Steering damper.  If the shaking is felt in the body, check;\n Shock absorber bushes (specifically the front). Leaf spring u-bolts may be loose.  If the shaking is felt in the driveline, check;\n ?   Shakes whilst decreasing speed.  If the shaking is felt in the steering wheel, check;\n Ball joints of the steering components. Steering damper.  If the shaking is felt in the body, check;\n Shock absorber bushes (specifically the front). Leaf spring u-bolts may be loose. Brake components (stuck or locking up components).  If the shaking is felt in the driveline, check;\n ?   Shakes at a specific speed or range of speed.  If the shaking is felt in the steering wheel, check;\n Front wheel bearings.  If the shaking is felt in the body, check;\n King-pin / swivel bearings. Worn shackles bushes.  If the shaking is felt in the driveline, check;\n ?   Shakes constantly and intensifies as speed increases.  If the shaking is felt in the steering wheel, check;\n ?  If the shaking is felt in the body, check;\n Tyres and wheels (unbalanced or unaligned)  If the shaking is felt in the driveline, check;\n Drive shafts may damaged/knocked and/or unbalanced. Diffs for damage (damage to pinion, bent tube etc).   A quote from a Patrol4x4 user;\n Had a MQ that shook like you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t beleive (shook the dust out of the dash) This went on for several years. Didn\u0026rsquo;t shake all the time but when it was going to you could feel it coming on. The only way to stop it was to pull up. Everything was replaced (complete diff hub to hub) but still the same. Replaced front springs and problem solved.\n &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Suspension&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Intercooling" data-content="&#34; Forced induction systems (ie turbocharged and supercharged) force additional air mass into the engine. This increases the efficiency of the engine and allows more fuel to be burned (and hence more power is made). As a by-product of the compression process, the air entering the engine gains heat. An excessively hot intake charge reduces the performance gains due to decreased air density. The extra heat may also cause detonation, excessive wear and heat damage to the engine block.\nAn intercooler is an air-to-air or air-to-liquid heat exchange device used to reduce the intake air heat. This increases the air density, providing increased efficiency from the forced induction system. It also reduces the likelihood of all the prior mentioned problems.\nMore info on Wikipedia.\nCompanies such as PWR make the required components.\nAir-to-Air Air-to-air intercoolers transfer the heat directly to the atmosphere. The heat exchanger in these systems is similar to a radiator, whereby the hot air passes through and transfers heat to metal tubes. The tubes have fins attached, which then transfer the heat to the atmosphere. They are placed in a direct air stream to achieve the best cooling results and can be improved even further with a fine water mist.\nAir-to-air intercoolers are a simple and cheap system, which makes them very popular. However, because they need to be located in a direct air stream, they are vulnerable to damage from debris. Further to this, they are usually connected with long intake pipework, which increases lag and pressure losses.\nAir-to-air intercoolers can be placed in a number of locations, such as the following.\nFront Mount The intercooler is located at the front of the vehicle, often between the grille and the radiator. A large amount of cool air is available in this location, which makes the intercooler rather effective. It is also easy to fit a large intercooler in at this location.\nIt is not without its drawbacks though. The intake pipework to this location will be rather long. It is also at the very front of the vehicle, making it highly susceptible to damage. In some cases, the intercooler can cause overheating issues to the engine, as it is in effect \u0026lsquo;blocking\u0026rsquo; the radiator and making the \u0026lsquo;cool\u0026rsquo; air that it uses hotter. This can also be a problem with spotlights and other items that are in front of the radiator.\nExample Installations  http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/let-intercooling-begin-dialup-warning-lots-pics-32651/ http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/my-sd33t-fmic-setup-21551/ http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/anyone-fiited-intercooler-sd33t-yet-12325/ http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/sd33t-turbotech-18630/ http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/front-mount-mk-43791/ http://outerlimits4x4.com/ol3/viewtopic.php?f=5\u0026amp;t=152196  Top Mount The intercooler is located above the engine. A bonnet scoop is required to feed air to the intercooler. Often, a body lift is required to fit the intercooler between the engine and the bonnet. This system has the advantage of short pipework, due to its proximity to the engine. It is also rather safe from debris (compared to front mount).\nIt also has some negative aspects though. Due to its close proximity to the engine, it can often suffer from heat soak (the intercooler becomes hot and has a reduced capacity). The size of a top mount intercooler is often smaller than a front mount, due to space constraints and bonnet scoop size etc. The air flow is often not as great either, also reducing the efficiency.\nExample Installations None found.\nSide Mount Not the most practical system in a 4wd, the intercooler is located at the front corners of the vehicle, ie underneath the headlights or in the wheel well. These intercoolers are usually not very big, due to space constraints. This sometimes necessitates the need for 2 or more small intercoolers, which require a large amount of pipework. Due to this and also the vulnerability of an intercooler in such a location, it is not recommended for your Patrol.\nHybrid Mount This is the idea of locating an intercooler in an unusual location. For example, it could be located above a battery tray and have air ducted from the radiator and out through a guard vent. This possibility of a hybrid system is only limited by your imagination, however its simplicity, safety, benefits and cost effectiveness should questioned.\nWater-to-Air Water-to-air intercoolers transfer the intake heat to a liquid medium (ie water). In a normal system, the intake air passes through a metal barrel cooler. Within these, the air is pushed through tubes which have fins attached. Water (or similar liquid) flows around the tubes and fins, which removes the heat. The hot water is then pumped to a conventional radiator elsewhere in the vehicle, where the heat is removed to the atmosphere.\nThese systems are rather complex and costly, due to the amount of components required (ie barrel cooler, pump and radiator as a minimum. Possibly a reservoir or cooling fan, depending on complexity of the individual system). This also means there are more things to go wrong, and all the components are dependent upon electricity.\nThe system does have a lot of advantages though. They are highly effective at cooling, and in extreme cases can be improved with the use of ice in a reservoir. The barrel can also be located in close proximity to the engine/intake, reducing lag due to long pipework. This also means it is safer from damage. Similarly, the radiator can be located in any location, even those not with direct airflow, as an electric fan can be used.\nExample Installations  http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/oops-i-accidenty-purchased-gt2860rs-turbo-bolted-my-sd33t-%3B-41245/  &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - SD33&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

On my leaf packs there were, 1 x guide pin, 2 x \u0026ldquo;leaf clamps\u0026rdquo;, one on each end of the leaf pack.\n Undo the two leaf clamps Undo the guide pin.  Here it helps to have something to grip around the pin (on the top of the leaf pack) Kneel onto the leaf pack to compress the leaves a bit when nearly undone, point the nut away from your self, as the leaf pack is under load and will come apart in individual pieces  Each individual leaf will have to be wire brushed to get all that rust off Use a sanding pad on the grinder to get a smooth surface afterwards Clean the surface of the leaf Give it a few coats of Etch Primer While the leaves were drying, I cut up some square pieces of chopping board. These would be slightly less wide than the leaf, and about 120 - 150mm long Reassemble the leaf pack as it came apart, adding a piece of chopping board/ Poly Urethane Put the guide pin back in and do the bolt up as far as you can while kneeling on it with all your weight, tighten that guide pin up as hard as you can  I noticed a bit was sticking out from the bolt (because I had removed leaves). I will be removing that part of the bolt. But for now, while I\u0026rsquo;m still testing it, I\u0026rsquo;ll leave them as is, and hope I don\u0026rsquo;t mess them up in the mean time :-)\nAfter having the leaf packs back together, they were given a lick of Rust Not Black Epoxy paint, that aught to keep them looking good for a bit.\n                               &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Suspension&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Lockers" data-content="&#34; There are many options available to lock the differentials of an MQ Patrol. This document aims to identify the common options and give info about them. It is not a how to and does not cover installation.\nSome companies providing aftermarket lockers include;\n ARB Air Lockers\n 4WD Systems Lokka\n Powertrax Lockright\n  FYI, all front diffs are C200 model. The standard Australian rear differential is the H233, and possibly some late-model MK had the H233B. Some other countries feature C200 rear. All countries use H260 as the heavy duty model. To identify your rear differential, refer to the Diff Info wiki-page for specs and pictures.\nAbout Lockers The standard \u0026lsquo;open\u0026rsquo; differential centre in many vehicles allows the wheels to have different speeds, which is ideal for cornering (when the inside wheel would travel a shorter distance than the outside wheel). This is not ideal offroad though, because when 1 wheel looses traction, all of the power is transferred to that wheel. This effectively means that axle and wheels are providing no movement. If this where occurring to the front and rear at the same time, you would be stuck.\nLockers aim to overcome this flaw by keeping both wheels powered, allowing obstacles to be overcome. They do this in different ways.\nTypes LSD LSD stands for Limited Slip Differential, which also explains its functions. They intend to keep the speed between 2 wheels as close as possible, allowing the vehicle to keep moving. Within an LSD, there are often clutch packs within the centre that \u0026lsquo;grip\u0026rsquo; the 2 wheels together. This still allows the wheels to differentiate, which makes them suitable for road driving and corners.\nWhilst their design does provide traction in more circumstances than an open centre, they often wear out and require the clutch plates to be replaced. If the LSD does wear out, they effectively become an open diff.\nThese were a factory option to the rear differentials of MQ Patrols. They are available second hand and often quite cheap.\nAuto-Lockers These lockers provide a mechanical lock between the wheels. This keeps the power to both wheels at most times. The \u0026lsquo;auto\u0026rsquo; part refers to the lockers ability to disengage, often when it sense side loads on the axles. This means the locker can unlock and function normally around corners etc.\nExamples of these include the Lokka and Lockright. They are often priced around $500 AUS, far cheaper than the part-time lockers, but more expensive than the LSD.\nPart-Time Lockers These are also a mechanical locker, but instead of automatically (un)locking as per above, this is controlled by the driver. In the case of the ARB Air Locker, this is achieved by supplying compressed air to the diff centre, which locks the centre. This means during most situations, the diff acts as a normal open centre, providing excellent cornering etc. When a hard obstacle is encountered, the diff can be locked to overcome it.\nOne downside to this arrangement compared to an auto-locker is when underestimating an obstacle. The driver may attempt an obstacle without locking the differential, and become stuck. They may then have to retry the obstacle with the lockers engaged. This increases the chances of the vehicle becoming damaged. Auto-lockers, on the other hand, would be engaged prior to attempting the obstacle, meaning it could be conquered first attempt.\nThe ARB Air Locker is a part-time locker. For a complete system, they are priced well in excess of $1,000 AUS. This is the most expensive locker option.\nFull-Time Lockers These lock the wheels together all of the time, providing no ability for the wheels to have different speeds, which can effect cornering (refer vehicle control section below for more info). These are also the harshest locker to the driveline and can cause axles to snap. They are (probably) illegal for road use in all states of Australia.\nThere are a number of ways to achieve a fully locked diff.\n Welded This involves welding the spider gears within an open differential together, which means they can no longer turn and hence allow the wheels to turn at different speeds. This is a very cheap way to lock the wheels, only requiring a bit of welding. Mini-Spool This is a solid 1 piece unit that replaces the spider gears within an open centre, keeping the wheels locked. They are fairly cheap and would be a bit stronger than a welded diff. They can also be swapped from one diff centre to another, or even be replaced by different locker. Full-Spool This replaces the whole centre, with a 1 piece unit. These are more expensive, but also stronger than a mini-spool.  Effect(s) on Vehicle Control Open centres and part time lockers allow proper vehicle control on road. Auto and full lockers do effect the vehicle in negative ways. The below paragraphs are a basic description of the problems faced by auto and full lockers. It should be noted that while LSD\u0026rsquo;s provide very similar control to an open center, they technically suffer the same problems as auto and full.\nFront It is a common misconception that the steering will be dangerous at all times with a front locker. In the case of an MQ, this is not true.\nWhen the wheels are engaged to the axles (ie hubs locked), the steering will be worse. This is because the wheels need to travel at different speeds around corners. An auto locker should unlock to provide acceptable steering, however a full locker will not. This will reduce the turning circle of the vehicle. Sometimes it may be necessary to exit the vehicle and unlock a hub, allowing the vehicle to negotiate a tight turn. Some people consider this a nuisance, others accept it because they know they have achieved wheel lock on the cheap (ie welded).\nThe locked wheels will also provide a \u0026lsquo;tracking\u0026rsquo; effect, wanting to pull the vehicle into a straight line.\nIt should be noted that part time lockers when engaged will have the exact same characteristics. So for example, when attempting to turn on a hard hill with the diffs locked, both cars will steer the same.\nWhen driving on road, the wheels would not be engaged to the axles (ie hubs unlocked). This means the wheels can turn at different speeds, not effecting the turning ability at all. Hence, they are perfectly safe.\nRear Unlike the front, the rear wheels cannot be disengaged from the axles. This means the locker is always effecting the vehicle. Locked rear differentials reduce the vehicles turning circle, as the wheels cannot travel at different speeds. This often results in one wheel \u0026lsquo;skipping\u0026rsquo; around a corner on road. An auto-locker should overcome this problem and unlock itself.\nIn wet weather, the locker can also induce over-steer, especially if the vehicle is accelerated around a corner. This is not a significant problem, but does require the driver to know what will happen and change their driving style to suit (or learn to drive sideways).\nOptions for C200 (Standard Front) Factory rear LSD was available for the MQ Patrol. The same LSD centre can be used in a front differential.\nNissan used the C200 in many vehicles. It also produced an independent version, the R200, which have the same centres. According to the ARB catalogue, the following vehicles use the C200, so any factory diff locks/LSD available for those vehicles will be compatible.\n Rear diff of 86-97, 4cyl engine Pathfinders, Xtera, Frontier and Navara. Front diff of 86-97, 6cyl engine Pathfinders, Xtera, Frontier and Navara.  It is worth noting at this point that the clutch discs within C200 are the same as those in H233 diffs.\nThe ARB Air Locker model number is RD107. Lokka are available, model number is unknown. Lockright do not show a listing in their product catalogue, probably not available. It is unknown if mini/full spools can be purchased.\nOptions for H233 (Standard Aus. Rear) Factory LSD was available for the MQ Patrol.\nThe H233 was used only in the MQ Patrol. This means their are no lockers available from other vehicles.\nThe ARB Air Locker model number is RD04. Lokka are available, model number is unknown. Lockright do not show a listing in their product catalogue, probably not available. It is unknown if mini/full spools can be purchased.\nSome people suggest that H233B were used in the rear of some MK Patrols (not all!). This is the same type as the front diff of a GQ/GU. The ARB Air Locker model number to suit is RD136. Lokka are available, model number is unknown. Lockright model number to suit is unconfirmed, either \u0026lsquo;3210 LR\u0026rsquo; (likely) or 3220. Refer to this Patrol4x4 discussion. It is unknown if mini/full spools can be purchased.\nOptions for H260 (Heavy Duty Rear) Factory LSD was available for the MQ Patrol.\nThis model diff was also used in the rear of some GQ and GU Patrols. Any lockers available for those models will be compatible (excluding full floating GU rear, which are only 34 spline).\nThe ARB Air Locker model number is RD70. Lokka are NOT available. Lockright do not show a listing in their product catalogue, probably not available. It is unknown if mini/full spools can be purchased.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Differential&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Oil Cooler" data-content="&#34; About The oil cooler on SD33 engines is located on the RH side of the engine, towards the top-rear corner of the block (behind the injector pump, above the oil filter and underneath the secondary fuel filter).\nIt is a simple system, with oil from the filter housing being pumped through tubes and into a sealed \u0026lsquo;radiator\u0026rsquo;. Engine coolant coming from the block is pumped around the radiator, before returning into the heads (Direction of coolant flow presumed, path is correct).\n\nRemoval It is a simple job to remove the oil cooler.\nYou should only do this when the engine is cold, or you may be burned!\n Remove the oil transfer pipe. Remove the support bracket for the fuel pipes. Remove the large banjo bolt to the head. Remove the cooler housing from the block.\nIt is recommended to remove the bolts in a spiral pattern, similar to removing a head. This is to minimise any warping to the cooler. Separate the radiator element from the cooler housing.  If the cooler has never been removed, it will likely require some persuasion. Be gentle, you do not want to damage the mating surfaces or warp the cooler. Coolant leaks may occur due to a poor seal.\nCleaning As seen in the photos, corrosion and scale from the engine gets trapped in the radiator, causing a large blockage. Hot oil can be a major contributor to engine overheating problems, so checking and cleaning the cooler is a worthwhile task. It is even more vital on turbo engines, as the turbo heats the oil to even higher levels.\nA \u0026lsquo;backyard\u0026rsquo; coolant flush is insufficient to clear the buildup. The photos below were taken after running the garden hose through both radiator hoses, the heater hoses and through the block drain bolt. Clean water was flowing from the entire engine, then the cooler was removed and photos taken.\n                Installation Assembly/installation is the opposite. Take note of the following;\n Check the cooler housing for flatness. You may need to file/sand it flat, or risk leaks. There are 2 paper gaskets for the radiator element to the cooler housing and 1 paper gasket for the cooler housing to block. New gaskets and a suitable gasket-goo should be used when re-assembling. There are 4 o-rings for the oil transfer pipe (one at each end of each \u0026lsquo;pipe\u0026rsquo;). These may need replacing. The banjo bolt is sealed with copper washers. Gasket-goo may be required to obtain a good seal, and/or new washers used.  Upgrading It would be possible to install a remote oil cooler.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - SD33&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="Performance Upgrades" data-content="&#34; SD33 It is possible to increase the performance of a NA SD33 engine, however the gains are minimal and the end result would still not be as good as a stock turbo engine.\nExtractors are available for this engine, and when coupled with an upgraded exhaust can get the engine revving easier and making more power. Improving the air intake to the engine (ie higher flowing filter, cold air intake) would also improve power. To make the most of these mods, the fuel could be increased slightly.\nThe NA engine would also benefit from the modifications listed below in the \u0026lsquo;Other\u0026rsquo; section.\nSD33T Turbo Upgrade Refer to the dedicated wiki page.\nBoost Increase TBA\nIntercooling Refer to the dedicated wiki page\nExhaust Upgrades 3\u0026rdquo; dump pipe is a popular mod. Refer this thread: http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/diy-mainfold-gasket-3-zorst-61334/\nFuel Mods None have been found.\nIntake Mods None have been found.\nOther Common Mods The mods listed above are the common upgrades to a turbo engine. If you wanted to go to the extreme with your engine though, here are some more ideas.\nDiesel Gas This provides great gains in power and economy on other diesel engines, so there is no reason why it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work on an SD33. Quoted from wikipedia; The above systems add small quantities of LPG with the primary aim of improving economy, but much larger quantities of LPG can be injected in order to increase power. Even at full output a diesel engine runs about 50% lean of stoichiometric to avoid black smoke production, so there is a substantial amount of oxygen in the intake charge which is not consumed in the combustion process. This oxygen is therefore available for the combustion of a substantial addition of LPG resulting in a large increase in power output.\nExhaust Heat Management Keeping the heat in the exhaust manifold and preventing it from heating the engine bay is important for all engines. If the exhaust is unprotected, the heat can increase the temperature of the intake manifold and incoming air. This means less oxygen into the engine. In extreme cases, the fuel can get hot and expand, similarily effecting performance.\nKeeping the heat contained within the exhaust keeps the intake cooler. The hotter exhaust gasses also move faster, providing a 2-fold performance increase. On a turbo engine, the hotter and faster moving exhaust gases will provide further benefits, as the turbo will spool earlier and faster.\nThere are a number of ways to contain the heat. The cheaper option is to use an exhaust wrap, which is basically a cloth tape wrapped around the exhaust. This has some disadvantages, as it can look bad and some people report it corrodes the wrapped metal rather quickly. The more expensive option of ceramic coating does not have these problems and can also be applied to intakes (keep the heat out) and also turbo housings.\nElectric Water Pump The standard water pumps are belt driven and this drains a few horsepower from the engine. Replacing the water pump with an electric alternative will restore this power and often make the engine more responsive (\u0026lsquo;snappier\u0026rsquo;). Electric water pumps can also improve engine cooling. Belt driven pumps are tied to the engine speed. At idle, the stock pump may not have sufficient flow, whereas at high RPM it may flow too fast. The electric pumps keep the coolant flowing at a steady and optimum rate at all RPMs.\nThere are 2 options available for the SD33. First is an in-line pump such as the Davies Craig, which gets mounted in the bottom radiator hose. Second is a kit which uses an electric motor mounted to the front of the engine, which then drives the stock water pump.\nElectric (Thermo) Fans Similar to the water pumps discussed above, the stock fan is belt driven and this drains a few horsepower from the engine. Replacing the fan with an electric alternative will restore this power and often make the engine more responsive (\u0026lsquo;snappier\u0026rsquo;).\nReducing Other Engine Drain Further to the water pump and thermo fans discussed above, there are also other items that drain power on the SD33. If you wanted to maximise every horespower, take the following into consideration.\nThe alternator places a fairly constant load on the engine, especially if running a big stereo, spot-lights etc. If your vehicle was purely a weekend-warrior, and you could make do without a stereo or driving lights, you could effectively get rid of the alternator all together. If your car sees regular use, upgrading your alternator to a new design may save some power due to efficiency increases.\nThe MQ Patrols are available with manual steering. Removing the power steering setup from your vehicle would free up some more power. Similarily, removing air-con will have a positive effect.\nAs you can see, it is possible to remove all accesories from your SD33 and still have a functioning vehicle. You could even remove the pulley from the engine all together (but should still keep the balancer, presuming these are seperate items).\nLastly, you could lighten the flywheel or even use the smaller (ie lighter) NA clutch.\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Engine - SD33&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

Refer to the relevant engine section for fitting the pump, eg SD33 instructions.\nFirst thing first, degrease and clean up the Power Steering unit before putting it on the car. Once that was done, I had to get the steering linkage out of the pitman arm. This is done easiest, by simply hitting the pitman arm repeatedly until it pops out. If you are reusing the steering link, this is the only way to go about it, as hitting the thread will ruin it.\nOnce that was out, it was a simple matter of pulling my front tyre off, and getting the linkage out of the pitman arm on the car, then remove the steering box from the chassis rail (you will also need to remove the earth wire and the rubber connection between the steering rod and steering box) and off it comes.\nLeave the two bottom bolts in the chassis rail as it helps when putting the power-steering box on the rail. Screw in the rods with thread in both ends, the go on the top.\n                          &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Steering&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

Bolt the pump up to it\u0026rsquo;s bracket. The SD33 with no power steering uses a different pulley as you can see. The pulley only supports two fan belts to the alternator, so this has to be changed. In order to do that, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to remove the shroud on the radiator and also the fan and viscous coupling. The bracket to adjust the tightness of the power steering fan belt is also required. The original one doesn\u0026rsquo;t serve any other purpose than being a lifting point.

The intent of this system was to overcome some of the problems with a conventional linkage system.\nThe previous patrol (G60), was released with a single drag-link from pitman arm to the wheel. This is a simple and effective solution, however it has 1 main problem. The pitman arm being at chassis level, is higher than the tie-rod, causing the drag-link to be on angle. When the drag-link is not horizontal, it introduces bump-steer (which gets worse the more this angle increases, like when adding suspension lift).\nNissan, in an attempt to overcome this, introduced in the MQ model a series of linkages and relay arms. The idea was that each linkage would be more horizontal, with the verticle requirements taken up by the relay arms. This (in theory) should give a better feeling in the steering and less bump-steer. However, this system introduced new problems. With all the additional ball-joints and linkages, the steering system wore out a lot quicker, negating any benefits.\nWith the release of the GQ model, Nissan reverted back to the single drag-link system. This system is also used by other manufactures/vahicles, such as the Toyota Landcruiser. It is evident by these facts, that the single drag-link system is superior, and you may wish to convert your MQ to such a setup.\nConversions There is a few methods to achieve the single drag-link conversion.\nAll methods require all of the old relay-arm system to be removed (everything between the pitman arm to the tie-rod).\nAll methods require the fabrication of a new drag-link.\n A common solution is to source 2 RH tie-rod ends and an old tie-rod. The tie-rod will need to be shortened one end, and a new thread tapped.\n Stock GQ drag-links are too long to use. However, The new drag-link is then bolted from the tie-rod to the top of the pitman arm. The problem with this method is that the\n  UNFINSIHED, MORE TO COME\nhttp://www.outerlimits4x4.com/ftopic159221-0-0-asc-.php\nhttp://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/single-dragkink-conversion-100225/\n&#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Steering&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">

If you know of one, please post on Patrol4x4.com.\nPatrol4x4 forum user landy has started making an upgrade kit using a Mitsubishi based TD04 turbo. More information in the following thread: http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/sd33t-turbo-upgrade-group-buy-114802/\n1980-83 MQ Patrol System When the MQ Patrol was released in 1980, the SD33 was only available as NA (naturally aspirated). A factory turbo version was not available until 1984, when the updated MK was released. In the interim period, an after-market turbo kit was available for the NA motors. These systems were likely installed by Turbotech in Western Australia.\nThe kit utilised the standard exhaust headers and intake manifold. A U shaped pipe was attached to the end of the end of the headers and positioned the turbo high and forward. The dump pipe ran horizontally until turning 90-degrees down between the headers and the starter motor, then 90-degrees again towards the rear of the car. Another U shaped pipe was used to join the turbo outlet to the intake manifold.\nThe turbo was installed in a \u0026lsquo;floating\u0026rsquo; style, which means it does not use a wastegate to control boost. This means that the turbo technically has unrestricted speed and boost. The throttle body was mounted in front of the turbo intake, which controlled the air flow (and hence the engine RPM).\nThe typical installation of these systems involved cutting out the LH side battery tray and fitting a large Donaldson filter in this position. The second battery was relocated to where the original cyclonic filter sat.\nThere were a few other minor mods to this system, including relocating the overflow bottle, adjusting the wiring to the temp senders, re-routing the brake vacuum hose and most vehicles had an after-market fuel filter fitted between the chassis hard-line hose the engine.\nPictures Additional photos can be found at: http://www.george4wd.taskled.com/mq2412.html.

                <tr class="wiki_page" data-title="V8 Conversion into 24 Volt Vehicle" data-content="&#34; You may want to use a V8 in your 24v MQ. Items on the new engine such as chokes, coils and starter motors will be 12v units, which poses a few problems and solutions.\nHow To It is possible to run 12v items, and hence a 12v motor, within a 24v vehicle, as explained on this wiki page. If you wish to proceed this way, it will be necessary to use 2 separate relays to control the motor;\n Connected to the 24v ignition circuit, to control the coil etc. Connected to the 24v starter wire, to control the starter motor.  The 24v alternator will need to be adapted (ie new brackets) to the engine you are using. The diesel alternators also have a vacuum pump on the back of the alternator, to run the brake booster. This can either be removed (leaves part of the alternator shaft exposed) or it could be maintained. V8\u0026rsquo;s with lumpy cams often have bad vacuum, and this could overcome that problem.\nProblems Keeping 24v Using a V8 in a 24v vehicle as indicated above is pointless for a few reasons;\n The motor does not benefit from the extra voltage. Having 2 batteries in the vehicle introduces extra \u0026lsquo;points of failure\u0026rsquo;. The second battery could be better utilised as a backup battery.  How to Change to 12v With the above taken into consideration, you may decide to convert the entire vehicle to 12v. This can be achieved in 2 ways;\n Source a factory 12v wiring loom and parts for conversion into your vehicle. Either a petrol or diesel loom will suffice, as both will need minor engine-bay modifications to suit. Modify the 24v wiring loom to suit 12v. You will also need to replace the 24v vehicle components (wipers etc). Please refer to this wiki page for additional information on what is required to convert a 24v vehicle.  How to Modify the Loom Whilst modifying the loom will solve all starting, charging and running issues, you will NOT be able to use the other 24v parts in the vehicle, such as the wipers. 12v replacements will have to be sourced, as mentioned above.\nThe following link contains a basic writeup on the conversion. A copy of the post is below for safe-keeping.\nhttp://www.outerlimits4x4.com/viewtopic.php?f=5\u0026amp;t=161057\u0026amp;start=0\n my mate purchased a former 24v diesel with a 253 in it.\nthe people that done the conversion retained the 24v system and alternator for the cars electrics and had hooked the starter, coil, fuel pump and thermo fan to 12v, which they took from the drivers side battery (PS- factory wiring takes its 12v from driver side battery as well for the radio and cig lighter. the 24v comes from the passenger side battery as explained by V8Patrol). All the 12v things were turned on via relays, which were hooked to a switch on the dash (like a kill switch, but they hadn\u0026rsquo;t been hooked to the key at all). the relays were located on the passenger side, between the battery tray and the firewall, exposed in the open. they also ran one of those redarc equalisers to fix the batterys. all the diesel stuff behind the drivers side battery tray was still there as well. he had bulk trouble with this, batterys were always going flat, then the alternator died, was all a bit dodge but it was working. i wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend doing it this way.\nthen he started talking about putting in subs and amps and stuff, so i convinced him to fix it and make the whole car 12v, we done it in one arvo, easy as. first we decided to use the drivers side battery, because that way there would be less wiring running around the car. we also decided to ditch the second battery all together at this stage, as it was dead anyway and he didnt want to spend money getting a new battery or a dual battery system. so first point of attack was un-tapping all the wiring in the engine bay. then we pulled out all the relays and the redarc that had been added, which left us with the stock loom. we started at the alternator and ripped out all the wires which were \u0026lsquo;useless\u0026rsquo;. this turned out to be most. FYI, the factory wiring all comes out of the drivers side of the firewall and runs around the front of the car to the passenger battery. so all the fuseable links that went to the passenger side battery stretched around the car already, so we cut all these back and hooked them up (with links) to the drivers side battery. All the wiring that went to the voltage regulator was removed (little module on passenger side near the headlight). then we removed to all the diesel components behind the battery cover on the drivers side. pretty much every wire came out here. the glow plug relay also hooks up to the battery, so this was removed. some of these wires go into the car, so we attached that part of the loom as well. next we removed the 12v accessory relay that is near the drivers side headlight. you can trace this back to the internal fuse block, we chopped it back and just hooked off the existing 24v accessory circuit. we then put in a new wire for the starter motor, but from memory i think the factory wire goes from the key to the diesel module and then another wire goes module to starter, so you could just link these. also, the power wire to key had some trickery going on, it got its power from somewhere wierd, so we ran a new thick wire to the battery and put a nice big fuse on the end. so that sorted out all the factory wiring. nothing needed doing to the headlights, dash, wipers etc.\nwe removed the 24v alternator and replaced it with a single wire 12v one. the original conversion had already ran a big fat 100A&#43; wire from the driver side battery to the starter motor, so we just made up a short wire (fat as well) form the alternator to the starter motor. he replaced all the bulbs in the car and got some second hand sealed 12v headlights for $30. i think you can get them for about this price new as well (for 1, not 2 though). he still needs to replace the wiper motor, this works on 12v but it is a bit slow. he\u0026rsquo;s not fussed atm, because it is summer. the car didnt have aircon and the original people didnt hook up the heater pipes (and he cbf as well) so we just ripped out the whole heater unit. gives heaps more leg room. only problem is he doesnt have a demister now, but i recommonded him this, which I run in my commodore because i ripped the heater unit out of it as well. http://www.calaisturbo.com.au/showthrea \u0026hellip; 563\u0026amp;page=3 - post 69 in particular\nthen we knocked up the wiring for the relays for all the petrol stuff. we hid these behind the battery cover where the diesel stuff was, this way it was shielded etc. to do this, we ran a big fat wire from the battery down through the side hole and connected this to a fuse block. we used a separate fuse for each petrol thing, which fed a separate relay. we could have ran a single relay and fed that straight from the battery, but we decided not to. a standard relay is like 30A, which would be fine for running a fuel pump, coil and the small davies craig thermo fan he had at the time. he was however shopping for some falcon thermo fans. I have these in my commodore and hooked each fan on its own 20A fuse, because apparently they are rated in the mid teens each (so i was told at the time). so if running these, it may have been too much for the 30A fuse. if you were running the mechanical fan, I would probably just go the 1 relay, keep it simple. anyway, we ran a wire from the ignition of the key to signal the relays. this was just linked from one relay to the next. we did the same thing with the earth as well and just hooked this into a wire that was already near by in the stock loom. We had a small mishap at this stage, I was not aware but there is actually 2 ignition \u0026lsquo;circuits\u0026rsquo; on the key barrel. They are both on when the key is at \u0026lsquo;run\u0026rsquo;, but when you turn the key to start, one of them turns off. and of course we hooked to this one. so when we were testing all our fresh circuits, we turned the key to run and were pretty pleased when everything was pumping and spinning as it should straight away. then we cranked it over and it spun but did not run. we were pretty devo, but worked it out quickly.\nso anyway, jist of my writing is just convert it to 12v properly. its heaps easier for everything, any accessories he hooks up now, he doesnt have to worry about where he is getting power from etc, or batterys dyeing when you in the bush.\n &#34;" data-tags="[&#34;Electrical&#34;]" data-date="2016-08-01">
