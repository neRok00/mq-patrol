The GQ (Y60 series) body has many similarities with the MQ, as it is basically an upgrade of the MQ. This results in many parts being compatible between both models. Unfortunately, the main body structure of the Y60 will not bolt onto an MQ chassis, as the chassis' are different widths, which results in the body mounts being in the wrong location.

## Dash

**Compatibility: Unknown**

## Heater / Air-con Unit

**Compatibility: Unknown**

If the firewall, transmission hump and dash were all similar, then presume this would work.

## Steering Column 'Accessories'

Steering column and attachments (steering wheel, indicator combo stalk, key barrel).
