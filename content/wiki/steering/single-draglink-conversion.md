## History

The MQ was released with a complex steering linkage system. The intent of this system was to overcome some of the problems with a conventional linkage system.

The previous patrol (G60), was released with a single drag-link from pitman arm to the wheel. This is a simple and effective solution, however it has 1 main problem. The pitman arm being at chassis level, is higher than the tie-rod, causing the drag-link to be on angle. When the drag-link is not horizontal, it introduces bump-steer (which gets worse the more this angle increases, like when adding suspension lift).

Nissan, in an attempt to overcome this, introduced in the MQ model a series of linkages and relay arms. The idea was that each linkage would be more horizontal, with the verticle requirements taken up by the relay arms. This (in theory) should give a better feeling in the steering and less bump-steer. However, this system introduced new problems. With all the additional ball-joints and linkages, the steering system wore out a lot quicker, negating any benefits.

With the release of the GQ model, Nissan reverted back to the single drag-link system. This system is also used by other manufactures/vahicles, such as the Toyota Landcruiser. It is evident by these facts, that the single drag-link system is superior, and you may wish to convert your MQ to such a setup.

## Conversions

There is a few methods to achieve the single drag-link conversion.

All methods require all of the old relay-arm system to be removed (everything between the pitman arm to the tie-rod).

All methods require the fabrication of a new drag-link.

*   A common solution is to source 2 RH tie-rod ends and an old tie-rod. The tie-rod will need to be shortened one end, and a new thread tapped.

*   Stock GQ drag-links are too long to use. However, The new drag-link is then bolted from the tie-rod to the top of the pitman arm. The problem with this method is that the
