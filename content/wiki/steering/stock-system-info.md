The steering system is the same across all MQ Patrols.
They were available in either manual or power steer.
They feature a multi link/arm system (ie drag link) from the steering box (pitman arm) to the wheel (tie-rod).
A steering damper is connected off one of the links.
The wheels are joined via a conventional tie-rod.
