Thanks to Seehuusen on Patrol4x4 forum for dontaing the following from his old website.

* * *

## Parts Required

1x Wire brush, in my case it was one you attach to the grinder
1x Sanding pad, also fitting the grinder
1x Etch Primer
1x Rust Not Black epoxy spray
1x Thin Poly Urethane chopping boards (in my case I used two, green for drivers side, red for passenger)
1x Stanley knife
Degreaser
Rags

## How To

The process for pulling the leaf packs apart isn't that difficult. On my leaf packs there were, 1 x guide pin, 2 x "leaf clamps", one on each end of the leaf pack.

1.  Undo the two leaf clamps
2.  Undo the guide pin.
 *   Here it helps to have something to grip around the pin (on the top of the leaf pack)
 *   Kneel onto the leaf pack to compress the leaves a bit
 *   when nearly undone, point the nut away from your self, as the leaf pack is under load and will come apart in individual pieces
3.  Each individual leaf will have to be wire brushed to get all that rust off
4.  Use a sanding pad on the grinder to get a smooth surface afterwards
5.  Clean the surface of the leaf
6.  Give it a few coats of Etch Primer
7.  While the leaves were drying, I cut up some square pieces of chopping board. These would be slightly less wide than the leaf, and about 120 - 150mm long
8.  Reassemble the leaf pack as it came apart, adding a piece of chopping board/ Poly Urethane
9.  Put the guide pin back in and do the bolt up as far as you can
10.  while kneeling on it with all your weight, tighten that guide pin up as hard as you can

I noticed a bit was sticking out from the bolt (because I had removed leaves). I will be removing that part of the bolt. But for now, while I'm still testing it, I'll leave them as is, and hope I don't mess them up in the mean time :-)

After having the leaf packs back together, they were given a lick of Rust Not Black Epoxy paint, that aught to keep them looking good for a bit.
