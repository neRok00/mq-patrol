## Banjo Filter (Primary)

The first filter in the stock system is located within a banjo bolt on the lift pump. The fuel being drawn from the chassis fuel line is first filtered by this small filter. It can clog up rather easily, which will cause an engine to run extremely bad, if at all. Many owners are unaware of its existence and often wonder why their vehicle doesn't run properly even after replacing the obvious canister filter discussed below. These images detail the location of the banjo filter.
Below you can see an example of a clogged filter and pipe, as what they should look like when clean. Pictures courtesy of Patrol4x4 user vanderbro [http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/687669-post1167.html](http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/687669-post1167.html)

There are many ways to clean the filter. Submersing in petrol or spraying with brake or carby cleaner should easily clear out any crud. Whilst spraying with compressed air would also clean it, you may damage the filter itself, so proceed with caution.

## Canister Filter (Secondary)

Was installed by the factory in a rather useless position, as the banjo filter has already blocked up with all the large debris before it reached the canister filter. It does filter out a lot of the finer particles that would pass through the rather course banjo filter.

## Adding an Extra Filter

To prevent the banjo filter from clogging up, some people put a filter in the rubber hose that connects the chassis fuel line to the banjo bolt. This filter will then relieve the stock filters of their filtering duties, hence preventing them (especially the banjo filter) from becoming blocked.
