There were 3 basic configurations of the SD33 available with the MQ Patrol. As the model progressed, various components of the engine were refined, and a turbocharger was added on some models.

Owners frequently want to know if their SD33 NA can handle a turbo. The simple answer is YES! Whilst improvements were made to the MK SD33-T engine to increase longevity, the SD33 has proved a robust engine and many NA versions have been turbocharged with no issues in the past.

Component | MQ SD33 NA | MK SD33 NA | MK SD33 Turbo | Notes |
----------|------------|------------|---------------|-------|
Piston Rings | 5 | 3 | 3 | For MK, a full keystone design was adopted for the top ring, and a ring carrier was added to the ring groove.
Crankshaft Arms | Standard | ? | Redesigned | - |
Oil Jets | No | ? | Yes | Cools the cylinders.
Extra Oil Passages | No | ? | Yes, to connect left and right oil galleries. Also extra external barbs for turbo oil supply/return. | - |
Oil Pump Flow (litres per minute) | 42 | ? | 48 Also stronger drive spindle. | To accommodate the oil jet spray and turbo lubrication.
Oil Filter | Paper Cartridge | Spin-On Filter | Spin-On Filter | The MK filter system is considered superior, plus the filter is cheaper and more common. The filter system from 1 engine can be swapped to another.
Oil Cooler | 3 core | ? | 5 core | Extra capacity to handle turbo heat.
Camshaft Journals | Standard | ? | Enlarged | - |
Cylinder Head Ports | Standard | ? | Enlarged | - | 
Cylinder Head Pre-Combustion Chambers | Standard | ? | Enlarged | - |
Cylinder Head Internal Steam Ports | Standard | Extra | Extra | Extra steam ports were added near the middle of the head, *probably* between pistons 2,3 and 4.
Inlet & Exhaust Manifolds | See note. | See note. | See note. | Different manifolds are used to suit turbo engines. They use the same flange and bolt patterns to the head and can interchange.
Air filter | Standard | ? | Enlarged | - |
Injector Pump | Throttle body on the intake manifold | ? | Throttle controlled in the pump itself | The injector pumps work in different ways, but can be swapped. Different length throttle cables are also used to suit.
Electronic Power | 24 volt | 12 volt | 12 volt | Different alternators, starter motors, glow plug relays and edic motors to suit. *Not all MK are 12 volt, there are a few odd-balls, but the majority are.
Clutch | ~240mm | ? | ~270mm | Larger clutch (and matching flywheel and pressure plate) to accommodate the additional power.
