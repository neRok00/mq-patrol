If you are looking to upgrade your current turbo, please refer to the [Turbo Upgrades][Wiki: upgrades] wiki page.

## New System

No genuine after-market kits are thought to be sold today. If you know of one, please post on [Patrol4x4.com](http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/).

Patrol4x4 forum user landy has started making an upgrade kit using a Mitsubishi based TD04 turbo. More information in the following thread: [http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/sd33t-turbo-upgrade-group-buy-114802/](http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/sd33t-turbo-upgrade-group-buy-114802/)

## 1980-83 MQ Patrol System

When the MQ Patrol was released in 1980, the SD33 was only available as NA (naturally aspirated). A factory turbo version was not available until 1984, when the updated MK was released. In the interim period, an after-market turbo kit was available for the NA motors. These systems were likely installed by [Turbotech](http://www.turbotech.com.au/) in Western Australia.

The kit utilised the standard exhaust headers and intake manifold. A U shaped pipe was attached to the end of the end of the headers and positioned the turbo high and forward. The dump pipe ran horizontally until turning 90-degrees down between the headers and the starter motor, then 90-degrees again towards the rear of the car. Another U shaped pipe was used to join the turbo outlet to the intake manifold.

The turbo was installed in a 'floating' style, which means it does not use a wastegate to control boost. This means that the turbo technically has unrestricted speed and boost. The throttle body was mounted in front of the turbo intake, which controlled the air flow (and hence the engine RPM).

The typical installation of these systems involved cutting out the LH side battery tray and fitting a large Donaldson filter in this position. The second battery was relocated to where the original cyclonic filter sat.

There were a few other minor mods to this system, including relocating the overflow bottle, adjusting the wiring to the temp senders, re-routing the brake vacuum hose and most vehicles had an after-market fuel filter fitted between the chassis hard-line hose the engine.
