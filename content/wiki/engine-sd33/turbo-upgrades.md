The factory turbo is limited to ~15psi. It is also of an old design, with sleeve bearings. To maximise the SD33T, the turbo could be swapped with a new-age model. These are more efficient, better quality etc and can greatly improve the power of engine.

Not a lot of people have taken this approach to their SD33T, so there is not much information.
