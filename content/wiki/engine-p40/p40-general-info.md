The P40 is the least common engine, although it is known to be a power-house (compared with the L28). It is a refined version of the engine found in the older 60 series Patrol. The P40 is a 4.0 litre straight 6, fueled by a 2-barrel carburetter.

It produced 114 HP / 85 kW power @ 3600rpm (DIN) and 200 ft-lb / 270 Nm torque @ 2000rpm (DIN).
