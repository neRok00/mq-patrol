It is possible to make a 2 inch body lift fit with minor to no adjustions. For anything higher then 2 inch you will have to modify the gear handles for both gearbox and 4wd, else they won't shift properly or vibrate out of gear. Also the steering column inside the engine bay must be made a little longer. The radiator has a plastic cover wich makes the fan get stuck if you don't remove the undermost part of the ring where the fan is mounted. The brake lining need some adjusting.
