There are many differences between MQ and MK Patrols, however the front-end change is the easiest to identify. MQ Patrols feature round 7'' headlights, whereas MK feature rectangular headlights.

The following body shapes were produced;

*   Long Wheel Base (LWB), in the following variations;

    *   Van, which featured 5 seats and barn doors.

    *   Station Wagon, which featured 7 seats and a split tailgate.

*   Short Wheel Base (SWB), which were 4 or 5 seater, and in the following variations;

    *   Hardtop, which had a low fibreglass canopy with a split tailgate.

    *   High-roof Hardtop, which had a high steel canopy with a split tailgate.

*   Utility, which were 2 or 3 seater.

The front end of all these body shapes are the same, with everything forward of the B-pillars being interchangeable (with the exception of MQ-MK headlights and grills).
