This wiki page is part of a 'series' on rebuilding the front diff, and continues on from [Stage 1 (Wheel Bearings)][Wiki: stage 1]. Also see [Stage 3 (CV)][Wiki: stage 3] and [Stage 4 (Diff Centre)][Wiki: stage 4].

This guide is not exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the relevant section of the [Service Manuals](/service-manuals/) such as [MQ Service Manual (1980)](/service-manuals/mq-service-manual-1980/) - [Chapter 14 - Front Axle](/service-manuals/mq-service-manual-1980/chapter-14-front-axle/ "service-manuals").

## Pre-start Warning

Before continuing, please understand that a bearing and its cup are a matched pair, even new ones. Using un-matched parts will result in premature bearing failure.

Whilst working with the king-pins, the bearings could easily become mixed up. It is advisable to mark each king pin (such as 'left-bottom') and its bearings and cups, to ensure you do not mix the parts up.

## Remove

The stages below are for replacing all the parts (ie a rebuild). If you are only repacking the swivel bearings or changing the CV, you will not have to perform every step (such as removing the wiper seal).

1.  Remove all parts from [Stage 1 (Wheel Bearings)][Wiki: stage 1].
2.  Remove the brake backing plate and stub axle, which are both held to the swivel hub by 6 bolts. This will expose the CV.
3.  Remove the thrust washer from the end of the CV.
4.  Remove the ~10 bolts from the back of the swivel hub, then pull the retainer ring, wiper seal and snap ring off the swivel hub (leave on the diff for now).
5.  Remove the top and bottom king-pin bearings and shims (4 bolts each).
6.  Manoeuvre the swivel hub from the diff knuckle. You can detach the steering tie-rod if required.
7.  Manoeuvre the snap ring and wiper seal over the knuckle and off the diff.

## Replace & Repair

1.  Through the top king-pin opening in the diff knuckle, use a suitable punch/cold chisel and hammer out the bottom king-pin bearing cup.

2.  Do the same for the top bearing cup.

3.  Clean all the old grease out of the knuckle.<br>
    _To remove the king-pin bearing cups, you will need to remove the CV (with axle) for access. Refer to [Stage 3 (CV)][Wiki: stage 3] for additional instructions. Even if you are not replacing the CV, it is a good idea to re-pack them with new grease, whilst the diff is apart._
    
4.  Carefully insert the new bearing cups, with the smaller opening of the cup inserted first.<br>
    _The bearing cups are a press fit and will require hammering in. Ensure you do not damage the tapered face that the bearing rolls on. One effective method is to place something wide and flat over the cup, such as the face of a gimpy. You can then strike the gimpy with a hammer, which will evenly force the bearing cup into the knuckle._
    
5.  Remove the bearings from the king-pins.<br>
    _This can be achieved with a bearing puller, or alternatively 2 angles can be placed between the king-pin plate and the bearing, and the king-pin driven out of the bearing._
    
6.  Clean all old grease from the king-pin, but leave a tiny smear on the 'pin' to aid bearing installation.

7.  Attach the new bearings, the the wide end of the bearing going on first.<br>
    _The bearings are a press fit and will require hammering on. Ensure you do not damage the rollers or cage. One effective method is to place the old bearing on top of the new bearing, and strike the old bearing with a hammer. This will push the bearing onto the king-pin and not damage the new bearing._
    
8.  Replace the o-ring seal on each king-pin.

9.  Remove the needle roller bearing from the end of the stub axle. This may be achieved with a bearing puller, although the cage often breaks. Alternatively, the bearing can be knocked out from the other end of the stub axle.

10.  Pack the new needle roller bearing with grease and insert it. A smear of grease on the outer race will let it slip in easier.<br>
    _The needle roller bearing is a press fit and will require hammering in. Ensure you do not damage the rollers or cage. One effective method is to place something wide and flat over the bearing, such as the face of a gimpy. You can then strike the gimpy with a hammer, which will evenly force the bearing into the stub axle._

## Assemble

1.  Manoeuvre the wiper seal and snap ring over the knuckle and onto the diff.
2.  Apply a light film or grease to the outside of the steering knuckle and the inside of the swivel hub.
3.  Manoeuvre the swivel hub onto the diff knuckle. If you removed the tie-rod, torque the ball joint to the value specified in the service manual.
4.  Attach the top and bottom king-pin bearings and shims (4 bolts each). Use equal amounts of shims on the top and bottom. Torque the bolts to the value specified in the service manual.
5.  Check that the swivel hub can move without excessive force being applied. Adjust the shims to suit.
6.  Attach the snap ring, wiper seal and retainer ring to the back of the swivel hub. Torque the ~10 bolts to the value specified in the service manual.
7.  Adjust the steering stop bolt to suit.
8.  Apply grease to the thrust washer and put onto the CV. Refer to the service manuals for the correct orientation of the chamfered edge.
9.  Lightly grease the surface of the CV.
10.  Attach the stub axle and brake backing plate to the swivel hub. Torque the 6 bolts to the value specified in the service manual.
11.  Continue the assembly of [Stage 1 (Wheel Bearings)][Wiki: stage 1].
