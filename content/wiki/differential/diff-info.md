## Facts

* All MQ's had a salisbury style diff at the front, known as the C200.  

* Australian MQ's had a banjo style diff at the rear, known as the H233. It is possible (though un-confirmed) that MK's had a slightly different version, the H233B.  

* Some MQ's featured a heavy duty banjo rear diff, known as the H260.  

* In countries other than Australia, the MQ's often feature a C200 in the rear, instead of H233/H260.

* LSD were available from factory for all 3 versions of the rear differential.

* The most common ratios in MQ Patrols were 4.3 and 4.6, with some 4.1 and 4.8 also being released.
