> I had a rear wheel bearing whinning for a little while now, had the axle out a while ago and degreased it and pushed new grease in with compressed air. got new bearings yesterday and fitted 1 to the noisey LH axle today.

> Thought I would share some pics of how I got the bearing and housing pressed off that any one can do at home, I only have a small 6 tonn press so there was no way I was going to get a axle in it.

> First I knocked out 2 studs, it was tight fit to get them out between the axle and housing. Then I found 2 bolts to put through the holes and used a spacer and nut. then as you do up the nut and bolt it will push the housing away from the axle. 

> My bolts didnt have long enough threads to do it in one go, so some extra spacers were added. Old bearing off.  New bearing in.

> This bearing came off easier than I expected, If it had been more stubborn I would of removed 4 studs and used 4 bolts to prevent putting to much pressure in one area of the housing and possibly snapping it around the bolt hole.
