## Facts

*   A standard GQ (Y60) CV is considered stronger than a standard MQ CV.

*   The GQ CV is slightly larger than an MQ CV, though it is small enough to fit inside both the MQ diff knuckle and stub-axle.

*   The spline from CV to axle is the same on both GQ and MQ.

*   The spline from CV to hub is larger on the GQ.

*   Manual hubs from a GQ (with their larger splines) are interchangeable with MQ hubs.<br>
    _Technically, the drive clutch ring is the only piece that needs swapping. The switch housings are the same._<br>
    Aftermarket GQ hubs are considered to be weak. GQ owners recommend the factory Nissan hubs be used.

*   Automatic hubs from a GQ are considered to be weak, and GQ owners often upgrade to manual hubs.
    It is not advisable to use automatic hubs for this conversion. Compatibility is unknown, but presumed okay.

## Parts Required
To do the conversion, you will require the following parts (recommended);

*   Standard GQ CV, these can be purchased new from eBay for ~$50 AUS each.

*   Nissan GQ manual hubs. The majority of a GQ manual hub is the same as an MQ hub, it is only the 'drive clutch' ring that differs. New from Nissan, the complete hubs cost $800+ and the clutch rings on their own cost $300+, therefore it is advisable to source some second-hand hubs. They can be hard to locate though, as they are also sought after by GQ owners.

## Install

**The method to swap a CV is explained on the following wiki page: [Front Diff Rebuild - Stage 3 (CV)][Wiki: rebuild stage 3].**

In addition, the following also needs to be considered.

*   There is a c-clip on the end of the axle that retains the CV, this should be left off. Often the GQ CV + MQ axle length is slightly different to MQ CV + MQ axle, and this may cause the steering to bind. Leaving the end c-clip off will allow the axle to slide in/out more. This does have some downfalls though, which are discussed in the 'Replace & Repair' section on the [Front Diff Rebuild - Stage 3 (CV)][Wiki: rebuild stage 3] page.

*   When putting the GQ hub-clutch engagement ring onto the end of the CV, the c-clip cannot be used to retain it any more as the groove in the GQ CV does not line up correctly. This should not cause any problems.
