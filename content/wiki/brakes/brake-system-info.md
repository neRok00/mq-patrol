All MQ's feature a common dual circuit hydraulic brake system.
They have a tandem master cylinder and are power assisted.
Later models also gained a load-sensing pressure proportioning valve.
Front brakes are 295mm ventilated discs with single piston colette style calipers.
Rear brakes are 270mm drums. Later models gained self-adjusting shoes.

The handbrake was a cable operated drum fitted to the rear output of the transfer case.
