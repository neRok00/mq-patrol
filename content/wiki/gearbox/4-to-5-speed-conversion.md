It is possible to convert a manual 4 speed vehicle to 5 speed.

This wiki page is for converting a factory motor. If you are intending to convert your 4 speed vehicle to 5 speed whilst also doing an engine conversion (such as a V8), please refer to this [wiki page][Wiki: v8 with 5 speed] for additional considerations.

## Differences

The 5th gear in the MQ is in an extension housing between the main housing and the transfer case. The main housing and transfer are the same on the 4 and 5 speed gearboxes, making parts interchangeable. The extension housing is 100mm long. This causes the transfer case to be moved further towards the rear of the vehicle, which has 2 effects;

*   The front drive-shaft needs to be longer and the rear shorter.
*   The transfer mounts are further towards the rear of the chassis.

These 2 differences must be addressed to complete the conversion.

If you want to see the difference, go to [gearbox length wiki page][Wiki: gearbox lengths].

### Solving Drive-shafts

The different drive-shaft lengths can be addressed in 3 ways.

*   Source correct length drive-shafts from another MQ. Please refer to this [wiki page][Wiki: factory drive shafts] for information.
*   Modify the length of the current drive-shafts (recommend to take to a professional workshop, as an un-balanced drive-shaft can cause damaging vibrations).
*   Have new drive-shafts made to suit.

### Solving Transfer Mounts

The different location of the transfer mounts can be addressed in 2 ways.

*   Cut the old mounts from the chassis and weld on new ones in the correct location. It may be possible to re-use the cut-off mounts if they were not damaged, or replacements will need to be fabricated.
*   Make adapter plates between the existing chassis mounts and the transfer case.

## Using Gearbox from Different MQ Engine

It is also possible to use gearboxes from different engines, such as a L28 5 speed on a SD33. There are a few differences that require addressing though;

*   The 3 motors all have different bell-housings. The connection of the bell-housing to the main gearbox housing is the same, so they can be interchanged.
*   The L28 motor is not as long as the P40 and SD33, which causes the gearbox to be located further forward). Because of this, each type has a unique top-plate on the gearbox, which locates the sticks correctly through the floor (SD33 and P40 are the same). The top-plates can be exchanged between the gearboxes to suit.
*   There are 3 different input shaft lengths, L28 = 210, SD33 and P40 pre '84 = 185, SD33 and P40 post '84 = 195. It is possible to interchange the input shafts. It may also be possible to make a modified spigot bush, however most people opt for the first option.
