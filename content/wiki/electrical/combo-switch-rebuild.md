Thanks to Seehuusen on Patrol4x4 forum for dontaing the following from his old website.

## The Problem(s)

The indicator had stopped working, and the hi-beams never worked in my car. So I decided to pull it all apart and rebuild the combo switch.

## Parts Required

*   3 prong puller
*   Philips head screw driver
*   De-greaser
*   Teflon Spray or Electrical Grease
*   A bit of fine sand paper

## How-To

First you pull the steering wheel off, if you have a sports steering wheel like me, then you'll need a puller to get the boss-kit off

Once the combo switch is off, you can start pulling it apart. Please use a spot that isn't messy, as there are small parts which can be lost (I actually nearly dropped a little metal ball down the sink).

1.  Start by degreasing the whole unit, it's going to have a whole heap of crud on it, if this has never been done before (image 1 & 2)
2.  Pull the black cover off on the back and un-screw the two screw holding the top assembly to the combo switch (image 3 & 4)
3.  give each of the little points a LIGHT sand to get rid of all the oxidation (image 5)
4.  re-assemble the headlight part of the combo switch
5.  unscrew the 2 screws holding the indicator assembly to the combo switch (image 6)
6.  Give that a bit of a sanding and put aside (image 7)
7.  Pull out the little bit, still in the combo switch. Be careful when you do this, as there is a spring and a metal ball on the other side, which you DON'T want to loose (image 8)
8.  This can be pulled apart carefully and given a light sand, put this aside (image 9)
9.  Now undo the washer mechanism from the combo switch (image 10 & 11). Again, here is another smaller ball, be careful not to lose it (image 12)
10.  give it all a light sanding and re-assemble (image 13)
11.  Before re-assembling anything, all electrical parts have been given a spray with this Teflon spray. You can use this (image 14) or electrical grease with no fear of having to do this job again in the near future
