The following information relates to the starter motors used on all 160/MQ/MK Patrols, and also GQ/Y60 Patrols. The table can be used for cross-referencing if a starter from another model Patrol can be used in your own.

Info supplied by jwaye2 on Patrol4x4 forum, see: [http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/will-gq-starter-motor-fit-into-mk-250978](http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/will-gq-starter-motor-fit-into-mk-250978)

As you will determine from the table below, the GQ starter motors have different specs to all the MQ motors, and hence are not usable.

Engine | Flange Diameter (mm) | Pintion Diameter (mm) | Pinion at rest (mm) | Pinion Teeth | Mount center A (mm)
--------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-----:|
L28 v8[^1]    | 82  | 28  | 8   | 8   | 110
L28 v9[^1]    | 82  | 29  | 10  | 9   | 110
P40           | 82  | 29  | 31  | 9   | 105
SD33 + SD33-T | 105 | 40  | 12  | 11  | 139[^2]
TB42          | 82  | 35  | 12  | 9   | 110
TD42          | 105 | 40  | 10  | 1 1 | 140[^3]
RB30 v8[^4]   | 82  | 28  | 8   | 8   | 110
RB30 v9[^4]   | 82  | 29  | 10  | 9   | 110

[^1]: L28 has 2 different versions, possibly for different gearbox/flywheel combinations (eg MQ 4 speed vs MK 5 speed?).
[^2]: SD33 Mount center B = 138mm, Mount center C = 93mm.
[^3]: TD42 Mount center B = 115mm, Mount center C = 80mm.
[^4]: RB30 has 2 different versions, possibly for different transmissions (auto vs manual?).<br>**NOTE:** Whilst they have the same measurements as MQ L28, the nose-cone is in a different position, and hence it does not interchange.
