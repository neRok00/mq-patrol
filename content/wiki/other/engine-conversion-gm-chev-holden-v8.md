Below are some common or desired GM/Chev/Holden V8 engine conversions. This list is not exhaustive and doesn't cover all the possible engines (such as [Chev LT engines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM_LT_engine)), but it is a guide.

Don't forget to check some other relevant wiki pages out, like the [Electrical](/wiki/electrical) page for [Converting 24 to 12 Volts][Wiki: convert volts], or the [Gearbox](/wiki/gearbox) page regarding [4 to 5 Speed Conversion whilst doing a V8 conversion][Wiki: v8 with 5 speed].

## Chev Small Block

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Small-Block_engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Small-Block_engine)
Much the same details as the Holden V8.

## Chev Big Block

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Big-Block_engine#Generation_2:_Mark_IV_Series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Big-Block_engine#Generation_2:_Mark_IV_Series)
Big blocks have the same bell housing and use the same engine mounts as a small block. Flywheels are likely a different bolt pattern, but it may be possible to swap clutch and pressure plates?!
No MQ builds have been found. There are a few GQ builds around.
Discussion on the use of a big block: [http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/big-block-into-mq-58060/](http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/big-block-into-mq-58060/)

## Duramax Diesel

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duramax_V8_engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duramax_V8_engine)
Quite an expensive engine, none have been seen in MQ Patrols yet.
There are some GU build threads on Patrol4x4 to get some ideas.

## Detroit Diesel (Brunswick)

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Diesel_V8_engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Diesel_V8_engine)
Commonly known in Australia as a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brunswick</span> conversion.

## Holden

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_V8_engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_V8_engine)
This thread explains the different clutch configurations and bell housing choices, spigots, etc: [http://outerlimits4x4.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=164170](http://outerlimits4x4.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=164170)

User [SwbAcko](http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/members/swbacko-66366/) has done the conversion. His progress was written in many threads, particularly the [What did you do to your patrol today MQ,MK?](http://www.patrol4x4.com/forum/nissan-patrol-mq-mk-12/what-did-you-do-your-patrol-today-mq-mk-55219/index129.html#post1041682) in late 2012-early 2013, so view his posts to find more.
