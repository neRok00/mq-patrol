Label | Function | Harness Wire Colour | About |
------|----------|---------------------|-------|
B / BAT | +12V Power | White/Red | Straight connection to the + post of the battery. This wire is a larger gauge than the other connections. This is the wire that the alternator uses to charge the battery. You can run a larger wire to the battery if you don't trust your old factory harness. A bigger wire would probably be better if you go to a high output alternator. This is a separate post on the back of the alternator with a plastic/rubber isolator to keep it from grounding to the alternator chassis.
E | Ground/Earth | Black | Connection to chassis ground/earth. The alternator should have a good ground through the block but this is a safety measure. Most cars are fine without this connection but it can be hooked up regardless. This is a separate post on the back of the alternator.
S | Voltage Sense | Yellow | Needs to see the battery voltage so that the alternator knows when to do its thing. This is the top of the 'T' connector on the back of the alternator.
L | Charge Lamp | White/Black | Wired directly to the charge lamp. The other side of the charge lamp goes through the fuse box to a + ignition source. This is the bottom of the 'T' connector on the back of the alternator.
P | Tach/Accessory | N/A | An extra connection that is an output to tachometers that were used on the 280ZX cars. It does not need to be used on earlier Z cars. A 1978 Z/ZX alternator sourced from a parts store will have the 'P' connector, which the stock MQ alternator does not have. 1978 - 1983 Z/ZX vehicles use the same alternator.
