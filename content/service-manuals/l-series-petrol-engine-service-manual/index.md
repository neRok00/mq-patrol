This manual covers the L series engine, which was used in multiple vehicles, such as the 240z ([see Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_L_engine)). The L series engines were available in 4 and 6 cylinder configuration, and with different carbeuretor setups. Whilst this manual does not refer to the L28 specifically, it is much the same as the L24.

Also refer to the relevant sections of the [MQ Service Manual (1980)](/service-manuals/mq-service-manual-1980), and the [L28 Wiki section](/wiki/engine-l28).
